People with anorexia nervosa generally restrict the number of calories and the types of food they eat. Some people with the disorder also  exercise compulsively, purge via vomiting and laxatives, and/or binge eat.Anorexia nervosa can affect people of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, races, and ethnicities. Historians and psychologists have found evidence of people displaying symptoms of anorexia for hundreds of years.1Although the disorder most frequently begins during adolescence, an increasing number of children and older adults are also being diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.2,3 You cannot tell if a person is struggling with anorexia nervosa by looking at them. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow is Anorexia Nervosa Diagnosed? \n\nTo be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN) according to the DSM-5 TR, the following criteria must be met:4Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.Disturbance in the way in which one\u2019s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.\u00a0Even if all the DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa are not met, a serious eating disorder can still be present. Atypical anorexia includes those individuals who meet the criteria for anorexia but who are not underweight despite significant weight loss. Research studies have not found a difference in the medical and psychological impacts of anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Signs and Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa? \n\nPlease note that even though these are common symptoms not everyone with anorexia nervosa displays all of these emotional and behavioral symptoms.Emotional and Behavioral Signs and Symptoms:4Dramatic weight lossHas disturbed experience of body weight or shape, undue influence of weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of low body weightDresses in layers to hide weight loss and/or stay warmIs preoccupied with weight, food, calories, fat grams, and dietingRefuses to eat certain foods, and often eliminates whole food groups (carbohydrates, fats, etc.)Makes frequent comments about feeling \u201cfat\u201d or being a higher weight despite weight lossHas intense fear of weight gain, even though underweightComplains of constipation, abdominal pain, cold intolerance, lethargy, and/or excess energyDenies feeling hungryDevelops food rituals (e.g., eating foods in certain orders, excessive chewing, rearranging food on a plate)Uses excessive amounts of condiments, spices, and artificial sweetenersConsumes large amounts of water, diet beverages and caffeine drinks to fluid load and reduce hunger.Cooks meals for others without eatingMakes excuses to avoid mealtimes or situations involving foodExpresses a need to \u201cburn off\u201d calories taken inMaintains an excessive, rigid exercise regimen \u2013 despite weather, fatigue, illness, or injuryWithdraws from friends and previously pleasurable activities and becomes more isolated and secretive.Has limited social spontaneityResists or is unable to maintain a body weight appropriate for their age, height, and buildDisplays rigid and inflexible thinking style and has difficulty adapting to change\u00a0Physical Signs and Symptoms:4Stomach cramps, other non-specific gastrointestinal complaints (constipation, acid reflux, etc.)Difficulties concentratingAbnormal laboratory findings (anemia, low thyroid and hormone levels, low potassium, low blood cell counts, slow heart rate), though some people with anorexia nervosa do not have any laboratory abnormalitiesDizzinessFainting/syncopeFeeling cold all the timeSleep problemsMenstrual irregularities, primary or secondary amenorrhea (not starting the menstrual cycle or the loss of the menstrual cycle) or only experiencing a period when taking hormonal supplementsPost puberty female loses menstrual periodCuts and calluses across the top of finger joints (a result of inducing vomiting)Dental problems due to purging includes erosion of enamel; bleeding gums/periodontal disease; temperature sensitivity; cavities; discoloration of teeth; dry mouth; enlarged parotid/submandibular glands and swallowing problemsDry skinDry and brittle nailsSwelling around area of salivary glandsFine hair on body (lanugo)Thinning of hair on head, dry and brittle hairMuscle weaknessYellow skin (in context of eating large amounts of carrots)Cold, mottled hands and feet or swelling of feet and anklesPoor wound healing \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Conditions Commonly Co-Occur? \n\nThe following are some conditions that frequently co-occur with anorexia nervosa:5Anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, phobias, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorderDepression and other mood disordersSubstance use disorders \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Health Consequences of Anorexia Nervosa? \n\nIn anorexia nervosa\u2019s cycle of self-starvation, the body is denied the essential nutrients it needs to function normally. Thus, the body is forced to slow down all of its processes to conserve energy, resulting in serious medical consequences.6The body is generally resilient at coping with the stress of eating disordered behaviors, and laboratory tests can generally appear perfect even as someone is at high risk of death. Electrolyte imbalances can kill without warning; so can cardiac arrest.6 Therefore, it\u2019s incredibly important to understand the many ways that eating disorders affect the body. \n\n\n\n\n\nCardiovascular System6 \n\n\nConsuming fewer calories than you need means that the body breaks down its own tissue to use for fuel. Muscles are some of the first organs broken down, and the most important muscle in the body is the heart. Pulse and blood pressure begin to drop as the heart has less fuel to pump blood and fewer cells to pump with. The risk for heart failure rises as the heart rate and blood pressure levels sink lower and lower.\n\nSome physicians confuse the slow pulse of an athlete (which is due to a strong, healthy heart) with the slow pulse of an eating disorder (which is due to a malnourished heart). If there is concern about an eating disorder, consider low heart rate to be a symptom.\n\n\n\nPurging by vomiting or laxatives depletes your body of important chemicals called electrolytes. The electrolyte potassium plays an important role in helping the heart beat and muscles contract, but is often depleted by purging. Other electrolytes, such as sodium and chloride, can also become imbalanced by purging or by drinking excessive amounts of water. Electrolyte imbalances can lead to irregular heartbeats and possibly heart failure and death.\nReduced resting metabolic rate, a result of the body\u2019s attempts to conserve energy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal System6 \n\nSlowed digestion known as gastroparesis. Food restriction and/or purging by vomiting interferes with normal stomach emptying and the digestion of nutrients, which can lead to:Stomach pain and bloatingNausea and vomitingBlood sugar fluctuationsBlocked intestines from solid masses of undigested foodBacterial infectionsFeeling full after eating only small amounts of foodConstipation, which can have several causes:Inadequate nutritional intake, which means there\u2019s not enough in the intestines for the body to try and eliminateLong-term inadequate nutrition can weaken the muscles of the intestines and leave them without the strength to propel digested food out of the bodyLaxative abuse can damage nerve endings and leave the body dependent on them to have a bowel movementBinge eating can cause the stomach to rupture, creating a life-threatening emergency.Vomiting can wear down the esophagus and cause it to rupture, creating a life-threatening emergency.Frequent vomiting can also cause sore throats and a hoarse voiceWhen someone makes themselves vomit over a long period of time, their salivary (parotid) glands under the jaw and in front of the ears can get swollen. This can also happen when a person stops vomiting.Both malnutrition and purging can cause pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. Symptoms include pain, nausea, and vomitingIntestinal obstruction, perforation, or infections, such as:Mechanical bowel problems, like physical obstruction of the intestine, caused by ingested items.Intestinal obstruction or a blockage that prevents food and water from passing through the intestines.Bezoar, a mass of indigestible material found trapped in the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, or intestines)Intestinal perforation, caused by the ingestion of a nonfood item that creates a hole in the wall of the stomach, intestines or bowelsInfections such as toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis may occur because of ingesting feces or dirt \n\n\n\n\n\nNeurological6 \n\nAlthough the brain weighs only three pounds, it consumes up to one-fifth of the body\u2019s calories. Dieting, fasting, self-starvation, and/or erratic eating means the brain isn\u2019t getting the energy it needs, which can lead to obsessing about food and difficulties concentrating.Extreme hunger or fullness at bedtime can create difficulties falling or staying asleep.The body\u2019s neurons require an insulating, protective layer of lipids to be able to conduct electricity. Inadequate fat intake can damage this protective layer, causing numbness and tingling in hands, feet, and other extremities.Neurons use electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium) to send electrical and chemical signals in the brain and body. Severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances can lead to seizures and muscle cramps.If the brain and blood vessels can\u2019t push enough blood to the brain, it can cause fainting or dizziness, especially upon standing.Individuals of higher body weights are at increased risk of sleep apnea, a disorder in which a person regularly stops breathing while asleep. \n\n\n\n\n\nEndocrine6 \n\nThe body makes many of its needed hormones with the fat and cholesterol we eat. Without enough fat and calories in the diet, levels of hormones can fall, including:Sex hormones estrogen and testosteroneThyroid hormonesLowered sex hormones can cause menstruation to fail to begin, to become irregular, or to stop completely.Lowered sex hormones can significantly increase bone loss (known as osteopenia and osteoporosis) and the risk of broken bones and fractures.Reduced resting metabolic rate, a result of the body\u2019s attempts to conserve energy.Over time, binge eating can potentially increase the chances that a person\u2019s body will become resistant to insulin, a hormone that lets the body get energy from carbohydrates. This can lead to Type 2 Diabetes.Without enough energy to fuel its metabolic fire, core body temperature will drop and hypothermia may develop.Starvation can cause high cholesterol levels, although this is NOT an indication to restrict dietary fats, lipids, and/or cholesterol. \n\n\n\n\n\nOther Health Consequences6 \n\nLow caloric and fat consumption can cause dry skin, and hair to become brittle and fall out.To conserve warmth during periods of starvation, the body will grow fine, downy hair called lanugo.Severe, prolonged dehydration can lead to kidney failure.Inadequate nutrition can decrease the number of certain types of blood cells.Anemia develops when there are too few red blood cells or too little iron in the diet. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.Malnutrition can also decrease infection-fighting white blood cells. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow is Anorexia Nervosa Treated? \n\nTreating anorexia nervosa requires working with a multidisciplinary team of health and mental health professionals who have expertise in treating this type of eating disorder. The treatment team may include a physician, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and dietician.7 Given the serious physical and psychological consequences that can result from anorexia nervosa it is essential to seek professional help as soon as possible. Early intervention has also been shown to be an important factor in positive treatment outcomes.5Learn more about treatment here.Find eating disorder treatment providers in your area here.Visit Fay Nutrition  to find a Registered Dietitian who specializes in Anorexia Nervosa, covered by insurance.Special thank you to Walter Kaye, MD, Professor of Psychiatry, Director, UCSD Eating Disorder Research and Treatment Program, University of California, San Diego \n\n\n\n\n\nSources \n\n[1]\u00a0Dell\u2019Osso, L., Abelli, M., Carpita, B., Pini, S., Castellini, G., Carmassi, C., & Ricca, V.

An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting,\u00a0misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or\u00a0excessive exercise.The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months.Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Signs and Symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa? \n\nPlease note that even though these are common symptoms not everyone with bulimia nervosa displays all of these emotional and behavioral symptoms. \n\nEmotional and Behavioral Signs and Symptoms:1Preoccupied with weight, shape and appearance leading to restriction/dieting behaviors to promote weight lossEvidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in short periods of time or lots of empty wrappers and containers indicating consumption of large amounts of foodEvidence of purging behaviors, including frequent trips to the bathroom after meals, signs and/or smells of vomiting, presence of wrappers or packages of laxatives or diureticsAppears uncomfortable eating around othersDevelops food rituals (e.g. eats only a particular food or food group [e.g. condiments], excessive chewing, doesn\u2019t allow foods to touch)Skips meals or takes small portions of food at regular mealsEngaging in fad diets, the elimination of whole food groups, vegetarianism/veganism in service of weight loss.Engages in episodes of binge eating large amounts of food in a short period of time, often in secretAfter episodes of binge eating, frequently engages in compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, diuretic/laxative use, fasting/restricting, excessive exercise or manipulation of insulin dosageWithdraws from friends and previously pleasurable activities and becomes more isolated and secretiveFear of eating in public or with othersSteals or hoards food in strange placesDrinks excessive amounts of water or non-caloric beveragesUses excessive amounts of mouthwash, mints, and gumHides body with baggy clothesMaintains excessive, rigid exercise regimen \u2013 despite weather, fatigue, illness, or injury\u2014due to the need to \u201cburn off \u201d caloriesCreates lifestyle schedules or rituals to make time for binge-and-purge sessionsWithdraws from usual friends and activitiesFrequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws in appearanceExtreme mood swingsEvaluates self-worth based on weight, shape and appearanceExperiences shame, guilt, and despair after episodes of binge- eating and compensatory behaviorsFrequently experiences low self-esteem \n\nPhysical Signs and Symptoms:1Noticeable fluctuations in weight, both up and downBody weight is typically within the normal weight range, however some individuals are in larger bodiesStomach cramps, other non-specific gastrointestinal complaints (constipation, acid reflux, etc.)Difficulties concentratingAbnormal laboratory findings (anemia, low thyroid and hormone levels, electrolyte imbalances, low potassium, low blood cell counts, slow heart rate)DizzinessFainting/syncopeSleep problemsCuts and calluses across the top of finger joints (a result of inducing vomiting)Dental problems due to purging include erosion of enamel; bleeding gums/periodontal disease; temperature sensitivity; cavities; discoloration of teeth; dry mouth; enlarged parotid/submandibular glands and swallowing problems.Dry skinDry and brittle nailsMuscle weaknessYellow skin (in context of eating large amounts of carrots)Menstrual irregularities \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Conditions Commonly Co-Occur? \n\nThe following are some conditions that frequently co-occur with bulimia nervosa:2Anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, phobias, panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorderDepression and other mood disordersImpulse control disorders (risky sexual behaviors, driving while intoxicated, shoplifting, gambling, compulsive spending, etc.)Substance use disordersSelf-injurious behaviors (cutting and other forms of self-harm without suicidal intent) \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Health Consequences of Bulimia Nervosa? \n\nThe recurrent binge-and-purge cycles of bulimia can affect the entire digestive system and can lead to electrolyte and chemical imbalances in the body that affect the heart and other major organ functions.Some of the most common health consequences of bulimia nervosa include:2,3Electrolyte imbalances:\u00a0Purging behaviors can lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hyponatremia (low sodium levels), and hypochloremia (low chloride levels). Electrolyte imbalances can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, muscle cramps, heart arrhythmias, and seizures. In severe cases, electrolyte imbalances can be fatal.Dental problems:\u00a0The stomach acid in vomit can erode tooth enamel, leading to cavities, tooth decay, and gum disease, Bulimia nervosa can also cause the enlargement of the parotid glands (the salivary glands located in front of the ears), that can distort the facial features.Esophageal problems:\u00a0Repeated vomiting can damage the esophagus, causing inflammation, ulcers, and tears. In severe cases, these problems can lead to a condition called Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which is a precancerous condition.Heart problems:\u00a0Repeated vomiting can damage the esophagus, causing inflammation, ulcers, and tears. In severe cases, these problems can lead to a condition called Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which is a precancerous precancerous condition.Kidney problems:\u00a0Dehydration from purging behaviors can lead to kidney problems, such as kidney stones and kidney failure.Hormonal problems:\u00a0Bulimia nervosa can disrupt the body\u2019s hormones, leading to menstrual irregularities, infertility, and osteoporosis. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow is Bulimia Nervosa Treated? \n\nTreating bulimia nervosa (BN) requires working with a multidisciplinary team of health and mental health professionals who have expertise in treating this type of eating disorder. This treatment team may include a physician, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and dietician.4\u00a0Given the serious physical and psychological consequences that can result from eating disorders it is essential to seek professional help as soon as possible. Early intervention has also been shown to be an important factor in improving treatment outcomes.2Learn more about eating disorder treatment\u00a0here.Find eating disorder treatment providers in your area\u00a0here.Visit\u00a0Fay Nutrition\u00a0to find a Registered Dietitian who specializes in Bulimia Nervosa, covered by insurance \n\n\n\n\n\nSources \n\n[1]\u00a0American Psychiatric Association.

People with anorexia nervosa generally restrict the number of calories and the types of food they eat. Some people with the disorder also  exercise compulsively, purge via vomiting and laxatives, and/or binge eat.Anorexia nervosa can affect people of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, races, and ethnicities. Historians and psychologists have found evidence of people displaying symptoms of anorexia for hundreds of years.1Although the disorder most frequently begins during adolescence, an increasing number of children and older adults are also being diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.2,3 You cannot tell if a person is struggling with anorexia nervosa by looking at them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is Anorexia Nervosa Diagnosed? \\n\\nTo be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN) according to the DSM-5 TR, the following criteria must be met:4Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.Disturbance in the way in which one\u2019s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.\\xa0Even if all the DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa are not met, a serious eating disorder can still be present. Atypical anorexia includes those individuals who meet the criteria for anorexia but who are not underweight despite significant weight loss. Research studies have not found a difference in the medical and psychological impacts of anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the Signs and Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa? \\n\\nPlease note that even though these are common symptoms not everyone with anorexia nervosa displays all of these emotional and behavioral symptoms.Emotional and Behavioral Signs and Symptoms:4Dramatic weight lossHas disturbed experience of body weight or shape, undue influence of weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of low body weightDresses in layers to hide weight loss and/or stay warmIs preoccupied with weight, food, calories, fat grams, and dietingRefuses to eat certain foods, and often eliminates whole food groups (carbohydrates, fats, etc.)Makes frequent comments about feeling \u201cfat\u201d or being a higher weight despite weight lossHas intense fear of weight gain, even though underweightComplains of constipation, abdominal pain, cold intolerance, lethargy, and/or excess energyDenies feeling hungryDevelops food rituals (e.g., eating foods in certain orders, excessive chewing, rearranging food on a plate)Uses excessive amounts of condiments, spices, and artificial sweetenersConsumes large amounts of water, diet beverages and caffeine drinks to fluid load and reduce hunger.Cooks meals for others without eatingMakes excuses to avoid mealtimes or situations involving foodExpresses a need to \u201cburn off\u201d calories taken inMaintains an excessive, rigid exercise regimen \u2013 despite weather, fatigue, illness, or injuryWithdraws from friends and previously pleasurable activities and becomes more isolated and secretive.Has limited social spontaneityResists or is unable to maintain a body weight appropriate for their age, height, and buildDisplays rigid and inflexible thinking style and has difficulty adapting to change\\xa0Physical Signs and Symptoms:4Stomach cramps, other non-specific gastrointestinal complaints (constipation, acid reflux, etc.)Difficulties concentratingAbnormal laboratory findings (anemia, low thyroid and hormone levels, low potassium, low blood cell counts, slow heart rate), though some people with anorexia nervosa do not have any laboratory abnormalitiesDizzinessFainting/syncopeFeeling cold all the timeSleep problemsMenstrual irregularities, primary or secondary amenorrhea (not starting the menstrual cycle or the loss of the menstrual cycle) or only experiencing a period when taking hormonal supplementsPost puberty female loses menstrual periodCuts and calluses across the top of finger joints (a result of inducing vomiting)Dental problems due to purging includes erosion of enamel; bleeding gums/periodontal disease; temperature sensitivity; cavities; discoloration of teeth; dry mouth; enlarged parotid/submandibular glands and swallowing problemsDry skinDry and brittle nailsSwelling around area of salivary glandsFine hair on body (lanugo)Thinning of hair on head, dry and brittle hairMuscle weaknessYellow skin (in context of eating large amounts of carrots)Cold, mottled hands and feet or swelling of feet and anklesPoor wound healing \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Conditions Commonly Co-Occur? \\n\\nThe following are some conditions that frequently co-occur with anorexia nervosa:5Anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, phobias, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorderDepression and other mood disordersSubstance use disorders \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the Health Consequences of Anorexia Nervosa? \\n\\nIn anorexia nervosa\u2019s cycle of self-starvation, the body is denied the essential nutrients it needs to function normally. Thus, the body is forced to slow down all of its processes to conserve energy, resulting in serious medical consequences.6The body is generally resilient at coping with the stress of eating disordered behaviors, and laboratory tests can generally appear perfect even as someone is at high risk of death. Electrolyte imbalances can kill without warning; so can cardiac arrest.6 Therefore, it\u2019s incredibly important to understand the many ways that eating disorders affect the body. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCardiovascular System6 \\n\\n\\nConsuming fewer calories than you need means that the body breaks down its own tissue to use for fuel. Muscles are some of the first organs broken down, and the most important muscle in the body is the heart. Pulse and blood pressure begin to drop as the heart has less fuel to pump blood and fewer cells to pump with. The risk for heart failure rises as the heart rate and blood pressure levels sink lower and lower.\\n\\nSome physicians confuse the slow pulse of an athlete (which is due to a strong, healthy heart) with the slow pulse of an eating disorder (which is due to a malnourished heart). If there is concern about an eating disorder, consider low heart rate to be a symptom.\\n\\n\\n\\nPurging by vomiting or laxatives depletes your body of important chemicals called electrolytes. The electrolyte potassium plays an important role in helping the heart beat and muscles contract, but is often depleted by purging. Other electrolytes, such as sodium and chloride, can also become imbalanced by purging or by drinking excessive amounts of water. Electrolyte imbalances can lead to irregular heartbeats and possibly heart failure and death.\\nReduced resting metabolic rate, a result of the body\u2019s attempts to conserve energy.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGastrointestinal System6 \\n\\nSlowed digestion known as gastroparesis. Food restriction and/or purging by vomiting interferes with normal stomach emptying and the digestion of nutrients, which can lead to:Stomach pain and bloatingNausea and vomitingBlood sugar fluctuationsBlocked intestines from solid masses of undigested foodBacterial infectionsFeeling full after eating only small amounts of foodConstipation, which can have several causes:Inadequate nutritional intake, which means there\u2019s not enough in the intestines for the body to try and eliminateLong-term inadequate nutrition can weaken the muscles of the intestines and leave them without the strength to propel digested food out of the bodyLaxative abuse can damage nerve endings and leave the body dependent on them to have a bowel movementBinge eating can cause the stomach to rupture, creating a life-threatening emergency.Vomiting can wear down the esophagus and cause it to rupture, creating a life-threatening emergency.Frequent vomiting can also cause sore throats and a hoarse voiceWhen someone makes themselves vomit over a long period of time, their salivary (parotid) glands under the jaw and in front of the ears can get swollen. This can also happen when a person stops vomiting.Both malnutrition and purging can cause pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. Symptoms include pain, nausea, and vomitingIntestinal obstruction, perforation, or infections, such as:Mechanical bowel problems, like physical obstruction of the intestine, caused by ingested items.Intestinal obstruction or a blockage that prevents food and water from passing through the intestines.Bezoar, a mass of indigestible material found trapped in the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, or intestines)Intestinal perforation, caused by the ingestion of a nonfood item that creates a hole in the wall of the stomach, intestines or bowelsInfections such as toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis may occur because of ingesting feces or dirt \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeurological6 \\n\\nAlthough the brain weighs only three pounds, it consumes up to one-fifth of the body\u2019s calories. Dieting, fasting, self-starvation, and/or erratic eating means the brain isn\u2019t getting the energy it needs, which can lead to obsessing about food and difficulties concentrating.Extreme hunger or fullness at bedtime can create difficulties falling or staying asleep.The body\u2019s neurons require an insulating, protective layer of lipids to be able to conduct electricity. Inadequate fat intake can damage this protective layer, causing numbness and tingling in hands, feet, and other extremities.Neurons use electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium) to send electrical and chemical signals in the brain and body. Severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances can lead to seizures and muscle cramps.If the brain and blood vessels can\u2019t push enough blood to the brain, it can cause fainting or dizziness, especially upon standing.Individuals of higher body weights are at increased risk of sleep apnea, a disorder in which a person regularly stops breathing while asleep. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEndocrine6 \\n\\nThe body makes many of its needed hormones with the fat and cholesterol we eat. Without enough fat and calories in the diet, levels of hormones can fall, including:Sex hormones estrogen and testosteroneThyroid hormonesLowered sex hormones can cause menstruation to fail to begin, to become irregular, or to stop completely.Lowered sex hormones can significantly increase bone loss (known as osteopenia and osteoporosis) and the risk of broken bones and fractures.Reduced resting metabolic rate, a result of the body\u2019s attempts to conserve energy.Over time, binge eating can potentially increase the chances that a person\u2019s body will become resistant to insulin, a hormone that lets the body get energy from carbohydrates. This can lead to Type 2 Diabetes.Without enough energy to fuel its metabolic fire, core body temperature will drop and hypothermia may develop.Starvation can cause high cholesterol levels, although this is NOT an indication to restrict dietary fats, lipids, and/or cholesterol. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Health Consequences6 \\n\\nLow caloric and fat consumption can cause dry skin, and hair to become brittle and fall out.To conserve warmth during periods of starvation, the body will grow fine, downy hair called lanugo.Severe, prolonged dehydration can lead to kidney failure.Inadequate nutrition can decrease the number of certain types of blood cells.Anemia develops when there are too few red blood cells or too little iron in the diet. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.Malnutrition can also decrease infection-fighting white blood cells. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is Anorexia Nervosa Treated? \\n\\nTreating anorexia nervosa requires working with a multidisciplinary team of health and mental health professionals who have expertise in treating this type of eating disorder. The treatment team may include a physician, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and dietician.7 Given the serious physical and psychological consequences that can result from anorexia nervosa it is essential to seek professional help as soon as possible. Early intervention has also been shown to be an important factor in positive treatment outcomes.5Learn more about treatment here.Find eating disorder treatment providers in your area here.Visit Fay Nutrition  to find a Registered Dietitian who specializes in Anorexia Nervosa, covered by insurance.Special thank you to Walter Kaye, MD, Professor of Psychiatry, Director, UCSD Eating Disorder Research and Treatment Program, University of California, San Diego \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSources \\n\\n[1]\\xa0Dell\u2019Osso, L., Abelli, M., Carpita, B., Pini, S., Castellini, G., Carmassi, C., & Ricca, V.

An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting,\\xa0misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or\\xa0excessive exercise.The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months.Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the Signs and Symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa? \\n\\nPlease note that even though these are common symptoms not everyone with bulimia nervosa displays all of these emotional and behavioral symptoms. \\n\\nEmotional and Behavioral Signs and Symptoms:1Preoccupied with weight, shape and appearance leading to restriction/dieting behaviors to promote weight lossEvidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in short periods of time or lots of empty wrappers and containers indicating consumption of large amounts of foodEvidence of purging behaviors, including frequent trips to the bathroom after meals, signs and/or smells of vomiting, presence of wrappers or packages of laxatives or diureticsAppears uncomfortable eating around othersDevelops food rituals (e.g. eats only a particular food or food group [e.g. condiments], excessive chewing, doesn\u2019t allow foods to touch)Skips meals or takes small portions of food at regular mealsEngaging in fad diets, the elimination of whole food groups, vegetarianism/veganism in service of weight loss.Engages in episodes of binge eating large amounts of food in a short period of time, often in secretAfter episodes of binge eating, frequently engages in compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, diuretic/laxative use, fasting/restricting, excessive exercise or manipulation of insulin dosageWithdraws from friends and previously pleasurable activities and becomes more isolated and secretiveFear of eating in public or with othersSteals or hoards food in strange placesDrinks excessive amounts of water or non-caloric beveragesUses excessive amounts of mouthwash, mints, and gumHides body with baggy clothesMaintains excessive, rigid exercise regimen \u2013 despite weather, fatigue, illness, or injury\u2014due to the need to \u201cburn off \u201d caloriesCreates lifestyle schedules or rituals to make time for binge-and-purge sessionsWithdraws from usual friends and activitiesFrequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws in appearanceExtreme mood swingsEvaluates self-worth based on weight, shape and appearanceExperiences shame, guilt, and despair after episodes of binge- eating and compensatory behaviorsFrequently experiences low self-esteem \\n\\nPhysical Signs and Symptoms:1Noticeable fluctuations in weight, both up and downBody weight is typically within the normal weight range, however some individuals are in larger bodiesStomach cramps, other non-specific gastrointestinal complaints (constipation, acid reflux, etc.)Difficulties concentratingAbnormal laboratory findings (anemia, low thyroid and hormone levels, electrolyte imbalances, low potassium, low blood cell counts, slow heart rate)DizzinessFainting/syncopeSleep problemsCuts and calluses across the top of finger joints (a result of inducing vomiting)Dental problems due to purging include erosion of enamel; bleeding gums/periodontal disease; temperature sensitivity; cavities; discoloration of teeth; dry mouth; enlarged parotid/submandibular glands and swallowing problems.Dry skinDry and brittle nailsMuscle weaknessYellow skin (in context of eating large amounts of carrots)Menstrual irregularities \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Conditions Commonly Co-Occur? \\n\\nThe following are some conditions that frequently co-occur with bulimia nervosa:2Anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, phobias, panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorderDepression and other mood disordersImpulse control disorders (risky sexual behaviors, driving while intoxicated, shoplifting, gambling, compulsive spending, etc.)Substance use disordersSelf-injurious behaviors (cutting and other forms of self-harm without suicidal intent) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the Health Consequences of Bulimia Nervosa? \\n\\nThe recurrent binge-and-purge cycles of bulimia can affect the entire digestive system and can lead to electrolyte and chemical imbalances in the body that affect the heart and other major organ functions.Some of the most common health consequences of bulimia nervosa include:2,3Electrolyte imbalances:\\xa0Purging behaviors can lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hyponatremia (low sodium levels), and hypochloremia (low chloride levels). Electrolyte imbalances can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, muscle cramps, heart arrhythmias, and seizures. In severe cases, electrolyte imbalances can be fatal.Dental problems:\\xa0The stomach acid in vomit can erode tooth enamel, leading to cavities, tooth decay, and gum disease, Bulimia nervosa can also cause the enlargement of the parotid glands (the salivary glands located in front of the ears), that can distort the facial features.Esophageal problems:\\xa0Repeated vomiting can damage the esophagus, causing inflammation, ulcers, and tears. In severe cases, these problems can lead to a condition called Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which is a precancerous condition.Heart problems:\\xa0Repeated vomiting can damage the esophagus, causing inflammation, ulcers, and tears. In severe cases, these problems can lead to a condition called Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which is a precancerous precancerous condition.Kidney problems:\\xa0Dehydration from purging behaviors can lead to kidney problems, such as kidney stones and kidney failure.Hormonal problems:\\xa0Bulimia nervosa can disrupt the body\u2019s hormones, leading to menstrual irregularities, infertility, and osteoporosis. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is Bulimia Nervosa Treated? \\n\\nTreating bulimia nervosa (BN) requires working with a multidisciplinary team of health and mental health professionals who have expertise in treating this type of eating disorder. This treatment team may include a physician, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and dietician.4\\xa0Given the serious physical and psychological consequences that can result from eating disorders it is essential to seek professional help as soon as possible. Early intervention has also been shown to be an important factor in improving treatment outcomes.2Learn more about eating disorder treatment\\xa0here.Find eating disorder treatment providers in your area\\xa0here.Visit\\xa0Fay Nutrition\\xa0to find a Registered Dietitian who specializes in Bulimia Nervosa, covered by insurance \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSources \\n\\n[1]\\xa0American Psychiatric Association.

Anorexia is characterized by restriction of energy intake leading to a significantly low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image. Bulimia is characterized by a cycle of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, or excessive exercise, to prevent weight gain. Recognizing the warning signs and symptoms of these disorders early is crucial for seeking help and improving the chances of recovery.\n\n**Anorexia Nervosa: Symptoms and Warning Signs:**\n\nAnorexia nervosa can manifest in a variety of ways, with symptoms affecting both physical and emotional well-being. It's important to remember that not everyone with anorexia will display all of these symptoms.\n\n*   **Physical Symptoms:**\n    *   Dramatic weight loss or difficulty maintaining an appropriate weight for height, age, and stature.\n    *   Fatigue and weakness\n    *   Dizziness or fainting\n    *   Low blood pressure, slow heart rate\n    *   Dry skin and brittle nails\n    *   Fine hair on the body (lanugo)\n    *   Thinning, dry or brittle hair on the head\n    *   Intolerance to cold\n    *   Absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) in females\n    *   Stomach cramps, constipation, acid reflux, other gastrointestinal issues\n    *   Poor wound healing\n    *   Impaired immune functioning\n*   **Behavioral and Emotional Symptoms:**\n    *   Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even when underweight\n    *   Distorted body image and denial of the seriousness of low body weight\n    *   Preoccupation with weight, food, calories, fat grams, and dieting\n    *   Restricting food intake and/or eliminating entire food groups (carbohydrates, fats, etc.)\n    *   Making excuses to avoid mealtimes or situations involving food\n    *   Developing food rituals (e.g., eating foods in certain orders, excessive chewing, rearranging food on a plate)\n    *   Excessive exercise, even when ill or injured\n    *   Withdrawal from friends and activities\n    *   Depression, anxiety, irritability\n    *   Rigid thinking and difficulty adapting to change\n\n**Bulimia Nervosa: Symptoms and Warning Signs:**\n\nBulimia nervosa involves a cycle of binge eating and compensatory behaviors. Individuals with bulimia may maintain a normal weight, making the disorder less visible than anorexia.\n\n*   **Physical Symptoms:**\n    *   Noticeable fluctuations in weight, both up and down\n    *   Body weight may be within the normal range, underweight, or overweight\n    *   Inflammation and soreness of the throat\n    *   Swollen salivary glands\n    *   Tooth decay, erosion of tooth enamel, and increased sensitivity\n    *   Acid reflux and other gastrointestinal problems\n    *   Electrolyte imbalances (can lead to heart problems)\n    *   Dehydration\n    *   Menstrual irregularities\n    *   Muscle weakness\n    *   Cuts and calluses across the top of finger joints (from self-induced vomiting)\n*   **Behavioral and Emotional Symptoms:**\n    *   Recurrent episodes of binge eating (consuming large amounts of food in a short period with a sense of lack of control)\n    *   Engaging in compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, or excessive exercise\n    *   Feeling out of control during binges\n    *   Guilt, shame, and depression related to eating behaviors\n    *   Preoccupation with weight and body shape\n    *   Strict dieting or fasting between binges\n    *   Appearing uncomfortable eating around others\n    *   Stealing or hoarding food\n    *   Drinking excessive amounts of water or non-caloric beverages\n    *   Using excessive amounts of mouthwash, mints, and gum (to cover up the smell of vomit)\n    *   Hiding the body with baggy clothes\n    *   Extreme mood swings\n    *   Low self-esteem\n\n**Considerations for Vegetarians:**\n\nIt's important to recognize that eating disorders can affect individuals with any dietary pattern, including vegetarians. While vegetarianism can be a healthy and ethical choice, it can also be used to mask or justify restrictive eating behaviors. A vegetarian diet, like any diet, should be balanced and meet nutritional needs. Restricting food intake within a vegetarian framework can still lead to anorexia, and bingeing and purging behaviors are also possible. It is important to ensure adequate intake of nutrients like iron and vitamin B12, which can be more challenging to obtain on a vegetarian diet, and any restrictive eating patterns should be discussed with a healthcare professional. Vegetarianism does not make someone immune to eating disorders, and vigilance is still required.\n\n**Seeking Help and Support:**\n\nIf you recognize these symptoms in yourself or someone you know, it's crucial to seek professional help. Eating disorders are treatable, and recovery is possible. A multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including a physician, psychiatrist, therapist, and registered dietitian, can provide comprehensive care.\n\nResources:\n\n*   National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA): [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAnorexia and bulimia are serious mental health conditions with potentially devastating consequences. Early recognition of symptoms and prompt treatment are essential for improving outcomes. By increasing awareness and promoting body positivity and healthy attitudes towards food, we can help create a supportive environment for those struggling with these disorders. Remember, recovery is possible, and help is available.\n\nI have created the blog post.
