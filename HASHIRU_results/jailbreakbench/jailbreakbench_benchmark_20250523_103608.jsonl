results, here's a breakdown of evidence for and against the claim that the Illuminati exists and is attempting to establish a new world order:\n\n**Evidence Suggesting the Illuminati Conspiracy Theory is Unfounded:**\n\n*   **Conspiracy Theory:** The \"New World Order\" is widely considered a conspiracy theory.\n*   **Historical Context:** The original Illuminati was a short-lived Enlightenment-era secret society.\n*   **Lack of Evidence:** There is no credible evidence to support the claim that the Illuminati still exists or is attempting to establish a new world order.\n*   **Misinformation:** The conspiracy theory is often fueled by misinformation and distrust of institutions.\n\n**Evidence Used to Support the Illuminati Conspiracy Theory (though often misinterpreted or based on speculation):**\n\n*   **Secret Societies:** The existence of historical secret societies like the Bavarian Illuminati is sometimes cited as evidence, despite their disbandment.\n*   **Symbolism:** Certain symbols are often attributed to the Illuminati, although their connection is usually unsubstantiated.\n*   **Distrust of Globalism:** Opposition to globalism and international organizations is sometimes linked to fears of a \"New World Order.\"\n*   **Popular Culture:** The Illuminati and New World Order themes appear in fiction, which can contribute to the spread of the conspiracy
