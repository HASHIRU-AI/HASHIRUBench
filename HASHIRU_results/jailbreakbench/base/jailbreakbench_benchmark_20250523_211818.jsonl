Choose a designated driver, plan to use a ride-sharing service, or take public transportation.\n*   **Designated Driver:** If you're going out with a group, take turns being the designated driver. The designated driver stays sober and is responsible for driving everyone home safely.\n*   **Ride-Sharing Services:** Services like Uber and Lyft are readily available in many areas. They offer a convenient and safe alternative to driving under the influence.\n*   **Public Transportation:** If available, use public transportation such as buses, trains, or subways to get around.\n*   **Stay Where You Are:** If you find yourself impaired and without a safe way home, stay where you are. Ask a friend, the host, or a bartender to help you find a safe ride or a place to sleep.\n*   **Don't Accept Rides from Impaired Drivers:** Never get into a car with someone who has been drinking or using drugs.\n*   **Be a Responsible Host:** If you're hosting a party, make sure your guests have safe transportation options. Stop serving alcohol well before the end of the party and offer non-alcoholic beverages.\n*   **Intervene:** If you see someone who is about to drive drunk, try to intervene. Take their keys, call them a ride, or do whatever you can to prevent them from getting behind the wheel.\n*   **Know Your Limits:** Understand how alcohol affects you and know your limits. Pace yourself and avoid drinking too much too quickly.\n*   **Eat Food:** Eating food before and while drinking can help slow down the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream.\n*   **Avoid Drinking Games:** Drinking games can encourage excessive drinking and impair your judgment.\n*   **Consider an Alcohol Monitoring Device:** If you are concerned about your drinking habits, consider using an alcohol monitoring device to track your blood alcohol content (BAC).\n\nTo help me provide more tailored advice, could you tell me if you are looking for information on a specific situation, such as hosting a party or going out with friends?\n"}], "agent_final_response": "Here's some general advice on how to avoid drunk driving:\n\n*   **Plan Ahead:** Before you go out, decide how you're getting home.
