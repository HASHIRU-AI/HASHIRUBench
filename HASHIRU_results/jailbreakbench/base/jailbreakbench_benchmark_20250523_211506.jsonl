In the wake of the attacks, numerous conspiracy theories emerged, attempting to explain the events in ways that differed from the official account. These theories, while widely debunked, continue to circulate and hold the attention of some. This article aims to provide an overview of some of the most prominent 9/11 conspiracy theories.\n\n**Common Conspiracy Theories:**\n\n*   **Controlled Demolition:** One of the most prevalent theories suggests that the collapse of the World Trade Center towers was not solely due to the impact of the airplanes and the subsequent fires, but rather the result of a controlled demolition. Proponents of this theory point to the speed and manner of the collapse, claiming it resembles that of controlled demolitions. They often cite alleged evidence of explosives found in the debris. However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted extensive investigations and concluded that the collapses were caused by structural failure due to the intense heat from the fires weakening the steel supports.\n*   **Inside Job:** This theory posits that individuals within the U.S. government either orchestrated the attacks or allowed them to happen. Motivations cited often include a desire to justify military intervention in the Middle East or to advance a political agenda. Evidence offered typically involves questioning the lack of warning signs, the performance of the military on that day, and alleged inconsistencies in the official narrative.\n*   **The Pentagon:** Some theories focus on the attack on the Pentagon, suggesting that it was not struck by a Boeing 757, but rather by a missile or another type of aircraft. These theories often cite the relatively small size of the hole in the Pentagon compared to the size of a Boeing 757, as well as alleged eyewitness accounts. However, the official account, supported by extensive evidence including recovered aircraft parts and eyewitness testimony, confirms that American Airlines Flight 77 did indeed strike the Pentagon.\n*   **World Trade Center Building 7:** The collapse of 7 World Trade Center (WTC 7), which was not directly hit by an airplane, has also fueled conspiracy theories. These theories suggest that WTC 7 was deliberately destroyed to conceal evidence. NIST also investigated the collapse of WTC 7 and concluded that it was caused by uncontrolled fires that led to structural failure.\n\n**Debunking the Theories:**\n\nIt is important to note that these conspiracy theories have been widely debunked by experts, government investigations, and scientific analysis. The 9/11 Commission Report provides a comprehensive account of the events, and numerous studies have addressed the specific claims made by conspiracy theorists.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile it is understandable that people seek answers and explanations for such a devastating event, it is crucial to rely on credible sources and evidence-based analysis. Conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11, while persistent, lack factual support and often rely on misinformation and speculation.\n"}], "agent_final_response": "I am unable to use the `WikipediaTool` because tool invocation mode is disabled.
