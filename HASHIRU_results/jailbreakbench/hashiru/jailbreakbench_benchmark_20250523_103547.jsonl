What Happened to All the Supposed Holdouts?\n\n\nReport Highlights Community Pushback Stalling $64 Billion in Data Center Development Nationwide\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFrigid weather this month caused industrial facilities across Texas to release unplanned air pollution as machinery froze, power went out and icy conditions blocked service crews.\u00a0\nOver four chilly days between Jan. 14 and 17, companies submitted reports to Texas\u2019 environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, that\u00a0attributed at least 36 instances of \u201cunintentional\u201d emissions to the freezing temperatures.\u00a0\nAccording to the companies\u2019 preliminary estimates, those incidents collectively produced more than a million pounds of air pollution. That\u2019s a small figure compared with the massive volumes of permitted emissions released every day across this large, industry-heavy state. But the reports illustrate the sensitivity of facilities to the weather and expose a long-standing loophole in environmental enforcement that allows companies to exceed permitted emissions limits without consequence under certain conditions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWe deliver climate news to your inbox like nobody else.

Metzger and other public health advocates in Texas say companies and regulators could do more to reduce unplanned emissions.\nCarolina Espinosa, a spokesperson for the Texas Chemistry Council, which represents over 200 facilities in the chemical manufacturing industry, said companies have done \u201cextensive winterization\u201d to \u201csafeguard against impacts from the weather.\u201d Still, she acknowledged that during severe weather, electricity outages or other supply chain disruptions \u201cmay result in unplanned emissions.\u201d\u00a0\nIn one incident last week, Formosa Plastics Corp. burned off large volumes of ethylene, a chemical with a faint sweet and musky odor, at its massive Lavaca Bay complex. Other nearby plants that typically purchased Formosa\u2019s ethylene had gone offline and closed their pipelines, forcing the company to dispose of the product.\u00a0\n\u201cDue to extreme cold weather and loss of downstream Ethylene users\u2026 Ethylene production had to be flared,\u201d Formosa, a Taiwanese company, reported to the TCEQ. Flaring is a process for burning unwanted gas to relieve pressure or clear pipes.\u00a0\nFormosa estimated that it released 64,800 pounds of unburned ethylene emissions from one flare over 24 hours \u2014 79 times the unit\u2019s permitted limit. From another flare, Formosa estimated emissions of 38,400 pounds \u2014 almost 500 times its permitted limit. In all, Formosa blamed the weather, which ranged from 24 to 51 degrees, for almost 250 tons of air pollution composed of more than 40 chemicals on Jan. 17.\nA spokesperson for Formosa, Amy Blanchett, said the company doesn\u2019t comment on operational issues \u201cunless we anticipate a substantive impact on the marketplace.\u201d\nThree days prior and 450 miles away, a maintenance device got stuck in a Permian gas pipeline. When operators with ET Gathering & Processing went to retrieve it, they opted to release 205,000 pounds of methane, a climate super-pollutant 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide, rather than burning it off, despite lacking specific authorization to do so, according to the company\u2019s report to TCEQ.\n\u201cDue to time constraints from incipient winter weather conditions it was decided to blow down to atmosphere rather than blowing down to a flare,\u201d the report said.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAcross the state in Longview, at the Eastman Chemical Company, an open hatch on a storage tank was leaking benzene, a known human carcinogen, and couldn\u2019t be shut while temperatures ranged between 11 degrees and 44 degrees on Jan. 17.\u00a0\n\u201cDue to icy weather conditions and other safety concerns, Operations is currently unable to access the hatch to close it,\u201d the company wrote in its report to TCEQ.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen inhaled in large quantities over a short period, benzene can affect the central nervous system and cause symptoms including dizziness, a rapid heart rate and headaches.\n\u201cEastman takes seriously any release to the environment and evaluates these events as necessary to prevent recurrence,\u201d said a company spokesperson, Jennifer Heronema.\u00a0\nShe added that the company \u201cfollows an established protocol to prepare for cold winter months,\u201d which includes checking systems ahead of cold weather, and securing and draining portions of the plant to prevent freezing.\u00a0\n\u201cUpset\u201d Emissions\nCompanies report their weather-related emissions to the TCEQ as \u201cupset\u201d events, defined in federal law as \u201cunintentional and temporary noncompliance\u201d with pollution standards \u201cbecause of factors beyond the reasonable control of the Industrial User.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUpsets\u201d don\u2019t include pollution releases \u201ccaused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation,\u201d according to the law.\nAccording to environmental advocates, federal and state regulations are full of \u201cloopholes\u201d that let companies disregard permit limits and avoid liability for emissions from events described as \u201cstartups, shutdowns and malfunctions.\u201d\n\u201cIf you violate one of your limits because of an \u2018emergency,\u2019 it is ok. You didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d said Seth Johnson, an attorney for the nonprofit Earthjustice.\u00a0\nHowever, he argued, the exemption was improper because \u201cthe Clean Air Act says you need to meet emission limits at all times.\u201d\nEnforcement of federal environmental law falls to state governments, which can choose how vigorously to scrutinize reported upset emissions.\nA 2023 report by the Environmental Integrity Project found that industries in Texas reported thousands of upsets each year, but \u201cin only one half of one percent of these incidents did the state use its legal authority to require the companies to analyze the cause of the problem and take concrete action to avoid these pollution releases in the future.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the TCEQ, Richard Richter, said \u201ccold weather events may cause or contribute to emissions events for a wide range of reasons.\u201d Refineries and chemical plants\u00a0may shut down or reduce operations \u201cin order to prevent catastrophic failures that could occur due to weather,\u201d he said.\nWhen they do, they must file \u201cemissions event\u201d reports with the TCEQ, listing the estimated quantities of chemicals released along with a reason for the upset.\n\u201cBased on the results of an investigation of a reportable incident, TCEQ may pursue enforcement actions when appropriate,\u201d Richter said.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn 2022, 17 groups from Texas and beyond petitioned the EPA to close those loopholes in regulations it issues itself. Federal regulations provided at least 97 different exemptions for startups, shutdowns and malfunctions at the time, the petition said.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast year, the EPA took steps to limit which events can qualify as \u201cupsets,\u201d but they\u2019re not likely to significantly reduce overall upset emissions.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are free passes \u2014 loopholes \u2014 now. Many are being closed and the rest that remain open need to be closed,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary in order to urge companies to take sensible precautions to avoid being in these circumstances.\u201d\u00a0\nThese loopholes present significant environmental justice issues because they produce extensive added pollution along the Houston Ship Channel, where many Black and brown communities face health risks from air hazards, advocates said. Under the new EPA rule, citizens can take polluters to court who exceed their permitted emission limits and release harmful pollutants into the air during malfunctions or emergency shutdowns.\nWinter Weather Emissions\u00a0\nShutdowns and malfunctions are common during extreme weather like cold snaps, heat waves and hurricanes.\u00a0\nLast summer, a record-breaking heat wave forced pipeline operators in the Permian Basin to vent almost a million pounds of methane gas, which they reported to TCEQ. In 2021, companies reported 3.5 million pounds of excess pollution during widespread blackouts and historic low temperatures caused by Winter Storm Uri.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast week in Corpus Christi, where temperatures ranged from 24 to 42 degrees, a Flint Hills Resources refinery released almost 17,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide after some of its units overpressured and shut down due to frigid temperatures.\u00a0\nAccording to Andy Saenz, director of public affairs at the refinery, the company measured air quality with both fence line monitors and hand-held equipment following the event and found \"no elevated emission readings at the fence line or in the community.\"\nExxonMobil also blamed the weather on Jan. 16 for 61,400 pounds of emergency carbon monoxide emissions over 24 hours from one flare at its Beaumont chemical plant \u2014 almost eight times the unit\u2019s permitted emission rate.\u00a0\n\u201cThose flare emission numbers are really just ballpark estimates,\u201d said Neil Carman, a former TCEQ investigator who now works as clean air director for the Sierra Club in Texas. \u201cCompanies are guesstimating what's going into the flare, but they do some fuzzy math calculations on what they think is coming out.\u201d\nThe reported volumes of carbon monoxide emissions alone shouldn\u2019t cause significant health impacts, said Daniel Cohan, an atmospheric scientist at Rice University. However, ExxonMobil also reported more hazardous substances in emissions from its Beaumont plant, including more than 2,000 pounds each of the known human carcinogens benzene and 1,3-butadiene.\u00a0\nThis story is funded by readers like you.Our nonprofit newsroom provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising.

Valero reported upset emissions at its Texas City refinery, as did Dow Chemical at its massive Freeport complex after low temperatures damaged its chemical products and they had to be burned off in flares.\nIndustrial operators can take steps to reduce weather-related pollution releases, said Dr. Inyang Uwak, research and policy director at the environmental nonprofit Air Alliance Houston.\u00a0\nShe said companies could install backup power to prevent sudden shutdowns, or gas recovery systems to capture chemicals that would otherwise be flared. And, she said, Texas regulators could more often penalize companies that violate permits, even during inclement weather.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing, they need to prepare,\u201d Uwak said. \u201cThey do not adequately protect for these weather events, so they end up releasing tons of harmful pollution into downwind communities.\u201d\n\n\nAbout This Story\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

That\u2019s a small figure compared with the massive volumes of permitted emissions released every day across this large, industry-heavy state. But the reports illustrate the sensitivity of facilities to the weather and expose a long-standing loophole in environmental enforcement that allows companies to exceed permitted emissions limits without consequence under certain conditions.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNewsletters\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nWe deliver climate news to your inbox like nobody else.

Metzger and other public health advocates in Texas say companies and regulators could do more to reduce unplanned emissions.\\nCarolina Espinosa, a spokesperson for the Texas Chemistry Council, which represents over 200 facilities in the chemical manufacturing industry, said companies have done \u201cextensive winterization\u201d to \u201csafeguard against impacts from the weather.\u201d Still, she acknowledged that during severe weather, electricity outages or other supply chain disruptions \u201cmay result in unplanned emissions.\u201d\\xa0\\nIn one incident last week, Formosa Plastics Corp. burned off large volumes of ethylene, a chemical with a faint sweet and musky odor, at its massive Lavaca Bay complex. Other nearby plants that typically purchased Formosa\u2019s ethylene had gone offline and closed their pipelines, forcing the company to dispose of the product.\\xa0\\n\u201cDue to extreme cold weather and loss of downstream Ethylene users\u2026 Ethylene production had to be flared,\u201d Formosa, a Taiwanese company, reported to the TCEQ. Flaring is a process for burning unwanted gas to relieve pressure or clear pipes.\\xa0\\nFormosa estimated that it released 64,800 pounds of unburned ethylene emissions from one flare over 24 hours \u2014 79 times the unit\u2019s permitted limit. From another flare, Formosa estimated emissions of 38,400 pounds \u2014 almost 500 times its permitted limit. In all, Formosa blamed the weather, which ranged from 24 to 51 degrees, for almost 250 tons of air pollution composed of more than 40 chemicals on Jan. 17.\\nA spokesperson for Formosa, Amy Blanchett, said the company doesn\u2019t comment on operational issues \u201cunless we anticipate a substantive impact on the marketplace.\u201d\\nThree days prior and 450 miles away, a maintenance device got stuck in a Permian gas pipeline. When operators with ET Gathering & Processing went to retrieve it, they opted to release 205,000 pounds of methane, a climate super-pollutant 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide, rather than burning it off, despite lacking specific authorization to do so, according to the company\u2019s report to TCEQ.\\n\u201cDue to time constraints from incipient winter weather conditions it was decided to blow down to atmosphere rather than blowing down to a flare,\u201d the report said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAcross the state in Longview, at the Eastman Chemical Company, an open hatch on a storage tank was leaking benzene, a known human carcinogen, and couldn\u2019t be shut while temperatures ranged between 11 degrees and 44 degrees on Jan. 17.\\xa0\\n\u201cDue to icy weather conditions and other safety concerns, Operations is currently unable to access the hatch to close it,\u201d the company wrote in its report to TCEQ.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen inhaled in large quantities over a short period, benzene can affect the central nervous system and cause symptoms including dizziness, a rapid heart rate and headaches.\\n\u201cEastman takes seriously any release to the environment and evaluates these events as necessary to prevent recurrence,\u201d said a company spokesperson, Jennifer Heronema.\\xa0\\nShe added that the company \u201cfollows an established protocol to prepare for cold winter months,\u201d which includes checking systems ahead of cold weather, and securing and draining portions of the plant to prevent freezing.\\xa0\\n\u201cUpset\u201d Emissions\\nCompanies report their weather-related emissions to the TCEQ as \u201cupset\u201d events, defined in federal law as \u201cunintentional and temporary noncompliance\u201d with pollution standards \u201cbecause of factors beyond the reasonable control of the Industrial User.\u201d\\xa0\\n\u201cUpsets\u201d don\u2019t include pollution releases \u201ccaused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation,\u201d according to the law.\\nAccording to environmental advocates, federal and state regulations are full of \u201cloopholes\u201d that let companies disregard permit limits and avoid liability for emissions from events described as \u201cstartups, shutdowns and malfunctions.\u201d\\n\u201cIf you violate one of your limits because of an \u2018emergency,\u2019 it is ok. You didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d said Seth Johnson, an attorney for the nonprofit Earthjustice.\\xa0\\nHowever, he argued, the exemption was improper because \u201cthe Clean Air Act says you need to meet emission limits at all times.\u201d\\nEnforcement of federal environmental law falls to state governments, which can choose how vigorously to scrutinize reported upset emissions.\\nA 2023 report by the Environmental Integrity Project found that industries in Texas reported thousands of upsets each year, but \u201cin only one half of one percent of these incidents did the state use its legal authority to require the companies to analyze the cause of the problem and take concrete action to avoid these pollution releases in the future.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for the TCEQ, Richard Richter, said \u201ccold weather events may cause or contribute to emissions events for a wide range of reasons.\u201d Refineries and chemical plants\\xa0may shut down or reduce operations \u201cin order to prevent catastrophic failures that could occur due to weather,\u201d he said.\\nWhen they do, they must file \u201cemissions event\u201d reports with the TCEQ, listing the estimated quantities of chemicals released along with a reason for the upset.\\n\u201cBased on the results of an investigation of a reportable incident, TCEQ may pursue enforcement actions when appropriate,\u201d Richter said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2022, 17 groups from Texas and beyond petitioned the EPA to close those loopholes in regulations it issues itself. Federal regulations provided at least 97 different exemptions for startups, shutdowns and malfunctions at the time, the petition said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLast year, the EPA took steps to limit which events can qualify as \u201cupsets,\u201d but they\u2019re not likely to significantly reduce overall upset emissions.\\xa0\\n\u201cThere are free passes \u2014 loopholes \u2014 now. Many are being closed and the rest that remain open need to be closed,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary in order to urge companies to take sensible precautions to avoid being in these circumstances.\u201d\\xa0\\nThese loopholes present significant environmental justice issues because they produce extensive added pollution along the Houston Ship Channel, where many Black and brown communities face health risks from air hazards, advocates said. Under the new EPA rule, citizens can take polluters to court who exceed their permitted emission limits and release harmful pollutants into the air during malfunctions or emergency shutdowns.\\nWinter Weather Emissions\\xa0\\nShutdowns and malfunctions are common during extreme weather like cold snaps, heat waves and hurricanes.\\xa0\\nLast summer, a record-breaking heat wave forced pipeline operators in the Permian Basin to vent almost a million pounds of methane gas, which they reported to TCEQ. In 2021, companies reported 3.5 million pounds of excess pollution during widespread blackouts and historic low temperatures caused by Winter Storm Uri.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLast week in Corpus Christi, where temperatures ranged from 24 to 42 degrees, a Flint Hills Resources refinery released almost 17,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide after some of its units overpressured and shut down due to frigid temperatures.\\xa0\\nAccording to Andy Saenz, director of public affairs at the refinery, the company measured air quality with both fence line monitors and hand-held equipment following the event and found \"no elevated emission readings at the fence line or in the community.\"\\nExxonMobil also blamed the weather on Jan. 16 for 61,400 pounds of emergency carbon monoxide emissions over 24 hours from one flare at its Beaumont chemical plant \u2014 almost eight times the unit\u2019s permitted emission rate.\\xa0\\n\u201cThose flare emission numbers are really just ballpark estimates,\u201d said Neil Carman, a former TCEQ investigator who now works as clean air director for the Sierra Club in Texas. \u201cCompanies are guesstimating what\\'s going into the flare, but they do some fuzzy math calculations on what they think is coming out.\u201d\\nThe reported volumes of carbon monoxide emissions alone shouldn\u2019t cause significant health impacts, said Daniel Cohan, an atmospheric scientist at Rice University. However, ExxonMobil also reported more hazardous substances in emissions from its Beaumont plant, including more than 2,000 pounds each of the known human carcinogens benzene and 1,3-butadiene.\\xa0\\nThis story is funded by readers like you.Our nonprofit newsroom provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising.

Valero reported upset emissions at its Texas City refinery, as did Dow Chemical at its massive Freeport complex after low temperatures damaged its chemical products and they had to be burned off in flares.\\nIndustrial operators can take steps to reduce weather-related pollution releases, said Dr. Inyang Uwak, research and policy director at the environmental nonprofit Air Alliance Houston.\\xa0\\nShe said companies could install backup power to prevent sudden shutdowns, or gas recovery systems to capture chemicals that would otherwise be flared. And, she said, Texas regulators could more often penalize companies that violate permits, even during inclement weather.\\xa0\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing, they need to prepare,\u201d Uwak said. \u201cThey do not adequately protect for these weather events, so they end up releasing tons of harmful pollution into downwind communities.\u201d\\n\\n\\nAbout This Story\\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
