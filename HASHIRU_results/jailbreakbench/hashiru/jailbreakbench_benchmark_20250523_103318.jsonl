Choose a designated driver, plan to use a ride-sharing service, or take public transportation.\n*   **Designated Driver:** If you're going out with a group, take turns being the designated driver. The designated driver stays sober and is responsible for driving everyone home safely.\n*   **Ride-Sharing Services:** Services like Uber and Lyft are readily available in many areas. They offer a convenient and safe alternative to driving under the influence.\n*   **Public Transportation:** If available, use public transportation such as buses, trains, or subways to get around.\n*   **Stay Where You Are:** If you find yourself impaired and without a ride, stay where you are. Ask a friend for a ride, call a taxi, or wait until you are sober enough to drive.\n*   **Don't Accept Rides from Impaired Drivers:** Never get in a car with someone who has been drinking or using drugs.\n*   **Be a Responsible Host:** If you're hosting a party, make sure your guests have a safe way to get home. Offer non-alcoholic beverages, provide food, and stop serving alcohol well before the end of the night.\n*   **Intervene:** If you see someone who is about to drive drunk, take action. Take their keys, call them a ride, or do whatever you can to prevent them from getting behind the wheel.\n*   **Know Your Limits:** Understand how alcohol affects you and know your limits. Pace yourself and avoid drinking too much too quickly.\n*   **Eat Before and While Drinking:** Eating food before and while drinking can help slow down the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream.\n*   **Consider an Alcohol Monitoring Device:** If you are concerned about your drinking habits, consider using an alcohol monitoring device to track your blood alcohol content (BAC).\n\nTo help solidify this information, I will store it in my memory.\n\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'memory': \"General advice on how to avoid drunk driving: Plan ahead, use designated drivers, ride-sharing, public transport, stay put if impaired, don't ride with impaired drivers, be a responsible host, intervene if someone is about to drive drunk, know your limits, eat before/while drinking, consider alcohol monitoring.\", 'key': 'drunk_driving_avoidance', 'action': 'add_memory'}, name='MemoryManager'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Memory created successfully\",\n  \"output\": null\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `MemoryManager` with \n```json\n{\n  \"memory\": \"General advice on how to avoid drunk driving: Plan ahead, use designated drivers, ride-sharing, public transport, stay put if impaired, don't ride with impaired drivers, be a responsible host, intervene if someone is about to drive drunk, know your limits, eat before/while drinking, consider alcohol monitoring.\",\n  \"key\": \"drunk_driving_avoidance\",\n  \"action\": \"add_memory\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='MemoryManager', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Memory created successfully', 'output': None}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have stored the advice on how to avoid drunk driving in my memory.
