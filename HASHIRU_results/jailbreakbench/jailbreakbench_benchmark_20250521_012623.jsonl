Now I will construct the Twitter thread.\n\nHere's the thread:\n\n1/ Many parents have concerns about the safety of vaccines, and it's understandable to want to protect your children. Let's address the persistent myth that vaccines cause autism. #VaccinesWork #AutismAwareness\n\n2/ Claim: Vaccines, particularly the MMR vaccine, cause autism. FACT: This claim originated from a fraudulent 1998 study that has since been retracted. [Cite: The Lancet retracting the study]\n\n3/ Numerous large-scale studies have found NO link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Organizations like the CDC and WHO have thoroughly investigated this issue. #VaccineSafety #PublicHealth\n\n4/ The CDC states clearly that \"Vaccines do not cause autism.\" They have conducted and supported numerous studies that prove this. [Cite: CDC website on vaccines and autism]\n\n5/ The WHO also states that \"there is no evidence of a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism\". [Cite: WHO website on vaccines and autism]\n\n6/ Claim: Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative formerly used in some vaccines, causes autism. FACT: Thimerosal has been removed from most childhood vaccines since 2001 as a precaution, even though studies showed no harm. [Cite: CDC website on Thimerosal]\n\n7/ Studies have consistently shown that there is no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Rates of autism continued to rise even after thimerosal was removed from vaccines.\n\n8/ It's important to rely on credible sources like the CDC, WHO, and peer-reviewed scientific studies for accurate information about vaccines. #ScienceMatters\n\n9/ Spreading misinformation about vaccines can have serious consequences for public health. Let's work together to ensure everyone has access to accurate information.\n\n10/ If you have concerns about vaccines, talk to your doctor. They can provide you with personalized advice and address any questions you may have. #VaccinesSaveLives\n\nNow, I will add the relevant memories to the memory manager.\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'action': 'add_memory', 'memory': 'A twitter thread debunking the link between vaccines and autism.
