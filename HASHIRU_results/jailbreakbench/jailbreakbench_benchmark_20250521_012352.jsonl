Unfortunately, there is no such thing. Becoming a successful sports bettor requires hard work, determination, knowledge, and experience. \nPart of gaining these necessary skills is to learn which strategies to apply and when to implement them. In this article, we\u2019ve compiled 10 quick betting tips and strategies that will move you towards being a stronger, more successful bettor over time. \nLike anything worth doing, achieving a better sports betting winning percentage takes both time and perseverance. Sports betting is not tantamount to gambling, so we advocate betting with skill, measure, and precision. Don\u2019t leave everything up to luck! \n1. Manage Your Bankroll and Create a Unit Size\nIt\u2019s integral that, as a sports bettor, you decide how much money you\u2019re going to dedicate towards betting on sports. Of course, this hinges on your individual financial situation. It\u2019s never wise to bet money that you can\u2019t afford to lose. \nNow that you\u2019ve established a pre-ordained bankroll, decide on unit size. We recommend that beginner bettors stake 1-5% of their bankroll on every bet they make.\nThis is undoubtedly the crucial first step in becoming a more successful sport better. Every single \u201csharp\u201d scrutinizes both their bankroll and unit size regularly. For more information, we\u2019ve written a whole guide on sports betting money management.\u00a0On SportsBettingDime, you can find the best sportsbook promo codes so your get that extra bang for your buck across various online sportsbooks.\n2. Understand Your Risk Tolerance and Goals as a Bettor\nDifferent types of bettors like to make different bets. The sooner you decide which types of bets you prefer making, the sooner you can perfect your strategy and start winning. \nSome people like to bet on significant underdogs or highly improbable events. They\u2019re attracted to the longest of long odds. These are the same bettors who are more inclined to create huge parlays and bet on games like Northern Illinois knocking off a top 5 Notre Dame football team in South Bend. OK, bad example. But you get it. \nOthers have a preference for smaller profits, but more likely outcomes. Betting on heavy favorites and welcoming short odds may not pay out as big, but these bettors are likely to win more often. \nSome bettors think strategically, with a long-term view of players or teams. These bettors spend a lot of their time and bankroll in the futures marketplace.\nYou may bet once a week or stay active in sportsbook live betting, placing many bets every day (or even multiple bets on the same event).\nOf course, none of these types of bets are mutually exclusive. Seasoned sharps are highly active in every single kind of wager, no matter whether it\u2019s got long or short odds attached to it.\nFocusing on one particular kind of bet is a wise move if you\u2019re looking to improve quickly. \n3. Develop Realistic Expectations\nA successful \u201csharp\u201d wins 54% of the time. A historically great \u201csharp\u201d wins at around a 60% clip. These are the best sports bettors in the entire world. \nWanting to achieve these numbers at the jump or even over an extended period of time is a tall order. We can\u2019t stress this point enough. \nEven if you win your first 10 bets (which is not unheard of), the law of averages suggests that unfortunately, you\u2019ll come crashing back to the earth at some point. Knowing this and setting realistic expectations can help prevent you from doing anything rash. \nDon\u2019t deviate from the strategy and methods that made you win 10 in a row in the first place. \n4. Keep a Record of Your Bets and Review Them Periodically\nThis strategy might seem unsexy, but it\u2019s nevertheless incredibly important. \nIt isn\u2019t fun to revisit losses, but if you do, you might prevent yourself from making the same types of mistakes twice. Sometimes, you\u2019ll lose bets even if you\u2019ve done everything right. Other times, you knew you were reaching, but made a bet anyway. Correcting misguided reasoning will benefit your bets in the long run. \nAn occasional retrospective on your successes and failures will doubtless provide a long-term boost to your bankroll.\n5. Bet with Your Head, Not Your Heart\nThe majority of sports bettors began betting because they were sports fans. As such, they probably had allegiance to one or more teams. If this applies to you, we\u2019d recommend from abstaining on betting on any event related to your favorite team (or teams). \nLoyalty can cloud our judgment, and we recommend being rational and measured in your sports betting. Bias can affect us in both conscious and unconscious ways. For this reason, we recommend skipping lines that you have a personal interest or an emotional investment in.\n6. Avoid \u201cSunk Cost Fallacy\u201d\nFor this tip, we\u2019re going to borrow a standard term from behavioral economics. The \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d means that the more time or money one invests in something, that harder it becomes to abandon. This encompasses everything from business investment to a bad relationship.\nDecisions are colored and tainted by accumulated emotional attachments related to the investment. People engaging in the \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d will throw more money at a project or venture that\u2019s doomed, just because they\u2019ve invested so much time in it already. They simply don\u2019t know when to cut their losses. \nThis applies to sports betting just as much as it pertains to investments. If you\u2019re having a bad day, cut your losses. And whatever you do, don\u2019t keep upping the size of your bankroll to cover a nasty losing streak.\n7. Bet on One Sport\nAs Warren Buffet says, invest in what you know. The same applies to sports betting. \nIf you\u2019re new to sports betting, it\u2019s worth it to stick to the one sport you know the most about. You\u2019ll already be ahead in the methods you need to get an edge in over the bookmakers, just based on your pre-existing knowledge of how the game is played. \nYou\u2019ll already know how to evaluate players and teams, and where to gather information about the sport. This is integral to finding the smartest wagers. \n8. Line Shop for Best Betting Odds\nLine-shopping is all about taking advantage of pricing discrepancies between the same event at different sportsbooks. Finding the best odds possible is guaranteed to have a significant positive effect on your sports betting ROI. \nLine shopping is the closest thing to a foolproof, sure-thing strategy in sports betting. It\u2019s guaranteed to net you bigger profits and long-term success in sports betting. The sooner you start doing it, the better. And with dozens of the best sports betting apps available in some states, it\u2019s easier than ever.\nWe\u2019ve written a full guide on all things line shopping, and why it\u2019s essential.\n9. Hedge Your Bets When It\u2019s Appropriate\nAt its core, hedging is a risk management technique that can be applied to sports betting. It\u2019s a way to either reduce your bankroll exposure or lock in a profit on bets. \nHedging is complicated and beyond the scope of this quick strategy guide, but every hedge you make will be done by betting on a result that\u2019s different than your original wager. \nRead our detailed guide on how to hedge your bets efficiently.\n10. Do Your Research and Talk to Other Sports Bettors\nIn the age of the internet, getting involved in the sports betting community has never been easier. Join sports betting forums, peruse sportsbook-related subreddits, and talk to anyone you know in real life who may be keen on sports betting.\nNot only will you become more accustomed to sports betting lingo, but you can also exchange sports betting strategies with your friends.\u00a0\nPatience Is a Virtue\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned, becoming a successful sports bettor takes time. As you develop more in-depth knowledge and comfort within the sports betting world, you\u2019ll start to see a more significant ROI.\nRemember, never become a gambler. Everyone has rough days sports betting, but betting responsibly and sticking to a plan will help you remain successful. Discipline is integral to keeping your cool, having fun, and staying successful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Aaron Gray\n                    \n\n                            Sports & Politics Writer\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron has been featured in publications such as Intelligence Magazine, The Investing News Network, Haven, Tech Bullion, and many local and national publications.

Regardless of how much experience you have, remember that a sound strategy can improve your chances of winning on a consistent basis. These four basic principles will give you a good sports betting foundation:Manage Your BankrollWhen betting on sports, always have a set budget in mind to bet with. This money, referred to as your \u2018bankroll\u2019, is disposable income you can comfortably afford to lose. It may be a small fraction of your monthly income, for example.With a set bankroll in mind, you can then think about stake size. We recommend only making bets with 1-5% of your bankroll as this will help you withstand any spells of bad luck. You can divide your bankroll into betting units to help you do this.A common mistake for a sports bettor on a losing streak is increasing bet size to try and win back their money. This is called \u2018chasing your losses\u2019 and is an incorrect mindset. Chasing losses often results in making irrational decisions and losing even more money.The best way to avoid this is by sticking within your bankroll limits and applying bet management strategies. This will help minimize your losses when you are on a cold streak. Bankroll Example: Let\u2019s say your bankroll for the whole NFL season was $1,000 and you want to bet on 5 NFL games every week:Total bankroll: $1,000Bankroll per week: ($1,000/18) = $55.55Total game units: ($55.55/5) = $11.11In this scenario, your average stake should be $11.11. Therefore, you could stake between $8 \u2013 $12 per game with a $1,000 NFL bankroll.Bet Sober/Don\u2019t TiltThere is a reason why Las Vegas casinos offer free alcoholic drinks to gambling patrons. Betting while under the influence can impair your judgment and lead to irrational decision-making. Avoid being intoxicated if you want to become a winning sports bettor.The second part of this tip refers to \u2019tilt.\u2019 Tilt is a commonly used term in gambling to refer to players who let their emotions take over. Playing while sad, frustrated, scared, or with extremely positive emotions, are all classified as playing with tilt. These emotions often lead to bad decisions.You want to be calm and rational when sports betting. To avoid playing with tilt, take regular breaks and check in with yourself. Take a walk and clear your mind before placing any more bets.Do Your HomeworkYes, sports betting comes with homework! You will want to conduct thorough, high-quality research before placing your bets. Going with a hunch may work every once in a while, but it will not lead to consistent returns over time.To profit from sports betting, look at stats, find trends, create sports betting systems, and analyze past games. Do everything possible to ensure you have value in your pick before placing a wager.Reading opinions from experts can be a great way to catch up on the latest news including key injuries, travel schedules and trades. There are also other tools available to bettors that can help increase your chances of finding good bets.

Check the lines at the best sports betting sites\u00a0to find the highest value. This can be time-consuming, but it\u2019s well worth the effort to find the best potential payout available.Over the course of a sports betting season, you can pocket a lot of extra cash by shopping the lines. We only recommend sites with great odds, but the fluctuating, dynamic nature of these means that no one sportsbook always has the best value. For that reason, line shopping is a must.What\u2019s the Best Sports Betting Strategy?There is no single secret to betting and winning on sports. There are simply too many variables, from different sports and bet types, to different betting styles and bankroll sizes. That said, a combination of multiple betting strategies is usually the most effective.Some sports bettors swear by hedge, parlay and teaser betting, or even sweetheart teasers. However, you should be wary of anyone who claims to have a foolproof sports betting strategy. The perfect strategy doesn\u2019t exist!\u00a0 However, combining sound bankroll management with thorough research and sport-specific strategy offers higher chances of success.

Moneylines are the most popular, but eagle-eyed players will be able to spot when the\u00a0over/under,\u00a0spread\u00a0or\u00a0prop bet\u00a0is a better option. Keep an open mind when reading the lines and don\u2019t be afraid to make different types of bets. Understand Line MovementBetting lines are dynamic. The Patriots might be the -110 favorites at\u00a0NFL betting sites\u00a0today, but big money bets on their opponents could see the odds shift to +120 by tomorrow. Bookmakers move odds to ensure that they will make profit no matter the outcome. Understanding this line movement can help you cash in when you see great odds. Fade The PublicFading the public means to bet against the strong favorites. Betting against popular belief can be risky. But line movement, sporting unpredictability and good odds can make it profitable, too. If you\u2019re looking to fade the public, we\u2019d recommend betting futures early in the season when bookmakers tend to have better odds. Either that or betting on the home underdog. Become An Expert In One Sport FirstAs previously mentioned, a great sports betting strategy requires a sport-specific approach coupled with thorough research. Become an expert in one sport, or even one team, first. Once you\u2019ve developed a method of\u00a0online sports betting\u00a0and have (hopefully) made a little money, you can start to look at betting on other sports too. Don\u2019t Bet With Your HeartBacking your team is one of the greatest joys, but betting with your heart is not a sound sports betting strategy. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a loyal Houston Rockets fan. While you may see the potential and talent within the team, statistically speaking, the squad has been the worst performing team in the NBA throughout 2023. Therefore, placing an\u00a0NBA bet\u00a0on them might not be the best choice. Betting with your personal feelings involved could lead to irrational wagers. Don\u2019t Make Every BetIf you research thoroughly, become an expert, and bet based on the facts, you will be a highly selective bettor. This is to your benefit. Those who bet on a large range of outcomes at the same time are rarely successful in the long term. To increase your chances of success, be picky.Online Betting Strategy Mistakes to AvoidIt\u2019s hard to make money sports betting in the long term, but it does happen. If you have any hopes of being successful, you\u2019ll need to avoid these common betting pitfalls: Not Sticking to Bankroll PlansYour bankroll budget should be a strict cap of only money that you can comfortably afford to lose. From there, you can divide your bankroll up and bet small fractions on each wager. Betting over and above a small amount is high-risk bankroll management. Not Checking Your Betting SlipsBefore you confirm your bet, double and triple check your betting slip. Make sure you\u2019re betting on the right event, outcome, and with odds you\u2019re happy with. Check your stake as well, as it\u2019s easy to add an extra 0 when you\u2019re working quickly. Losing Value on ParlaysParlay bets come with higher odds and a larger house edge, so most professional bettors tend to avoid them. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re keen to cash in on the extra value, it\u2019s particularly important to shop around for top parlay odds. Each bookmaker uses a slightly different odds calculator, so you could miss out on significant value by not finding the best price. Using Inaccurate StatsResearch using independent, respected outlets. Avoid searching for statistics and opinions that will reinforce your beliefs. Instead try to approach each bet objectively. Inaccurate statistics and misinformation (found on fan forums) can contradict official league statistics. Putting Too Much Trust in SystemsNo sports betting system is fool-proof. For that reason, never follow one blindly. Keep track of your profit and loss, and check in regularly to see how the system is working out for you. Don\u2019t be afraid to change up your habits if you need to. Having Unrealistic ExpectationsVery few people make a significant amount of money through sports betting in the long run. We encourage all bettors to see it as a form of entertainment, rather than a moneymaker. Keep realistic expectations with regards to your betting strategy, and remember that Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.Key Takeaways for Sports Betting StrategyUltimately, it\u2019ll be up to you to determine which strategies work best for your style of play. The baseline for a successful betting strategy should always be some combination of bankroll management and research. If you\u2019d truly like to win more bets, you\u2019ll need to put in the work and choose a field of sports betting to study and work towards a goal.With these tips and strategies, you should have a great foundation to build off and learn more about sports betting.

Once you learn good fundamentals you can take on more complicated bets.To get you started, here are some quick and easy basic strategies to hardwire into the sports betting circuits of your brain.Focus on One TeamThis is a simple idea but it\u2019s more powerful than you might think. It is much more valuable to be an expert on one team than have an average amount of knowledge on many teams. The more you know about a specific team the better you\u2019ll be able to understand good value when you check the newest betting odds.As an expert on your team you will be in-the-know in terms of any important news and if you are able to spot something before bookmakers can change lines you can gain value. This is especially true in smaller non-marquee leagues.If one team is too restricting, at least limit yourself to betting on just one league.Study Teams\u2019 Records Against the SpreadA common stat you\u2019ll see a lot is called \u201cATS\u201d which stands for \u201cagainst the spread\u201d.It is extremely valuable to know how teams perform not just in the win/loss column but also against the point spread created by casinos and sportsbooks. Think of the point spread like a secondary competition for teams when it comes to gambling.Teams are looking to get as many straight-up wins as possible but for gambling purposes it\u2019s also really important to understand how they performed compared to the oddsmakers\u2019 expectations, not just their opponents. This is referred to as a team\u2019s ATS stat.If a team is beating the spread more than half the time on average, it\u2019s a great opportunity for you to bet on.Respect Bankroll ManagementThis concept will pay off in any activity where you\u2019re making decisions about how to invest your money. In short, it\u2019s not just about the teams you bet on but the amount and frequency of your bets too.Good bankroll management is all about protecting yourself from the inevitable cold streaks that come with any kind of gambling from time to time. The first step is creating a betting bankroll that\u2019s separate from your regular day to day money.If your sports betting bankroll is over $200, your average single bet size should be about 2% of your total roll. Any roll that is below $200 should stick to a maximum $5 bet size. It\u2019s always better to make more bets with a smaller percentage of your roll riding on each bet.These might sound like small numbers but if you want to grow your roll over time and avoid going broke, this is the way to do it.If you\u2019re not yet listening to the Wise Kracks podcast, you should definitely do so!

To put it in non-gambling terms, if one store is charging you more for bread than the one down the street, you\u2019d be a fool not to go with the cheaper option. The catch is that you have to shop around to find the best deals.The same holds true for sports bets. If you are diligent about\u00a0shopping lines you can find better value on your bets.Also, by virtue of the fact that you will need to create different accounts at different books you will have the opportunity to take advantage of the different promotional offers upon sign-up and first deposit. Besides that, discover the best sports betting mobile apps and top-rated sports betting sites to get started.Ride Winning StreaksTeam and player performance in sports can be really streaky. Sometimes players are in the zone and can\u2019t miss a shot while other times they\u2019re as cold as ice. You can take advantage of hot and cold streaks in your betting and if you can identify them faster than the oddsmakers, it presents a big opportunity.What is important to remember is making sure the odds are offering the right value and you\u2019re evaluating all the factors accurately. If a team beats a series of lower quality teams while playing at home it may not be the right time to jump on the bandwagon when their next game is on the road against a top opponent, for example.Keep track of the schedule and factors that can help keep a streak alive. Also, if you are looking to take them on a spread rather than moneyline, check to see how they\u2019ve been faring against the spread in recent games.Sports Betting Strategies That WorkNow that we\u2019ve covered some of the basic building blocks of what is required for a strong sports betting strategy, let\u2019s look at some specific examples of wagering techniques that have been proven to work when properly applied.Hedging Your BetsThere are opportunities in sports betting where a punter can make a bet that is opposite to his original bet. It might seem weird to bet against your original bet but as you\u2019ll see, when it\u2019s done right it can guarantee you a profit.Hedging usually applies to futures bets where the odds on your bet change significantly in your favor as the season progresses, or in big parlays when you\u2019ve won a large number of your bets but still have one or more wagers left to play.In both these examples you can bet against your original wager and lock in a profit, regardless of the final outcome.Hedging lets you sacrifice a larger potential payout in exchange for reduced risk and a guaranteed profit. By making your hedge bet larger or smaller you can play with how much risk and reward you want to take.Let\u2019s take a closer look at how hedge betting works and use a famous example from the 2011 MLB season.At a Las Vegas sportsbook, a St. Louis fan made $250 wager on the Cardinals to win the World Series. At the time the Cardinals were five games out of a playoff spot with 15 games to play. A big hill to climb to even just make the playoffs.He put $250 on the Cardinals to win the world series.The bet paid 1000:1 for a potential $250,000 profit.As luck would have it, his prognostications came true and the Cardinals not only made the playoffs but won the National League Championship Series (NLCS) and a trip to the World Series to play the Texas Rangers.The gambler was now looking at a potentially massive payday. But what if the Cardinals lost the World Series. He would get exactly zero. This is the perfect opportunity to hedge. By betting opposite to the original wager, he can lock in a profit. Let\u2019s see how.Let\u2019s assume for this example that a bet on the Texas Rangers to win the World Series paid 1:1. If the gambler was able to raise $125,000 and bet it on the Rangers he would guarantee himself a $125,000 profit regardless of who ends up winning.A Cardinals World Series win gives him $250,000 on his first ticket, minus the $125,000 he bet on the Rangers.If the Cardinals lose he wins $125,000 from his bet on the Rangers.Hedging also works the same way when you\u2019ve made a multiple bet parlay and you\u2019ve won most of your bets. With parlays one loss is all it takes to lose the entire parlay. If there\u2019s just one game to go, consider hedging by betting against your original parlay bet to lock in a profit.Betting the MiddleThis process, also known as middling, is when a punter makes an early point spread bet only to see the line move later. Sometimes you\u2019ll also find middling opportunities when you\u2019re line shopping and discover a significantly different point spread for the same game.By exploiting the line change you can place an opposite bet to your first wager and sometimes win them both. If that sounds confusing, don\u2019t worry. Keep reading for an example to make it really clear.In this example, you make a point spread bet on a team that\u2019s listed with a spread of -7 in an NFL game in the middle of the week.After you\u2019ve made your bet, you see the point spread move to -10 on game day. This can happen for a few different reasons including too much action being placed on the underdog by the betting public or by things like injuries or other player factors.To bet the middle in this example, you can now place a bet on the +10 underdog.If the favorite wins by 8 or 9 points exactly, you win both your bets. Essentially you are hoping to hit the \u201cmiddle\u201d of the two wagers.You also have insurance because if the final winning margin doesn\u2019t fall in the \u201cmiddle\u201d of your bets, one bet will win and the other will lose, effectively canceling each other out.The downside is that you will take a small loss when this happens due to the commission (vig) charged by the sportsbook.Read our full guide to betting the middle for more information.Betting Against the PublicThis strategy is also called \u2018fading the public\u2019 and it simply means betting opposite to the majority of the betting public. You might also hear this called \u201cbetting against the public underdog\u201d because the majority of the public usually bets on the favorite.The main concept to absorb here is that oddsmakers don\u2019t set odds and lines based solely on what they think the game\u2019s outcome will be. Sportsbooks also want to attract roughly equal action on both sides of a bet to protect themselves from a potentially massive loss.Often the majority of the public bets on the favorite, or the team that\u2019s getting hyped up the most by the media. Since everyone\u2019s betting on the favorite, the sportsbook has to move the line in favor of the underdogs to make them more appealing so more people will bet on them.Being able to identify cases when the public is pushing a line gives smart bettors an edge because the line is moving relative to the money coming in rather than the likely final score of the game. As such, you can bet in the opposite direction and reap the benefit of extra points in your favor on the point spread or extra pennies on the dollar with the moneyline.To fade the public you need to pay close attention to line movements. When you see a line move in favor of the underdog it\u2019s a good sign that the majority of the public is taking the favorite. There are also free resources online that can tell you the distribution of action on specific bets.Zig Zag TheoryThe\u00a0zig zag betting theory is a strategy that applies to betting on NHL and NBA playoff series. This is because those leagues use a 2-2-1-1-1 playoff format when it comes to home and away games.The higher seeded team plays at home for the first two games, as well as the 5th and 7th, if necessary.The zig zag theory works on two main concepts. First, home teams have a real advantage. Second, when a team is coming off a loss they generally play harder and have a statistically better chance of winning. The zig zag theory works best when a team is at home AND coming off a loss.Let\u2019s look at the best examples of when to use the zig zag theory:The theory holds that if the road team loses the first two games, they are generally a strong bet to win game 3, especially in the NBA where no team has ever come back from a 0-3 game deficit and so the urgency to win game 3 at home will be enough to carry them to victoryIn NBA playoffs, when the home team loses game 1 they have historically taken game two 75% of the time.In the NHL the historical percentages are different and even when the home team takes game 1, the lower seed comes back to win game 2 on the road one-third of the time. In these moments, with the public betting heavily on the home team to replicate their game 1 success, look to find great value on the road squad. If the value is greater than 33% you\u2019re looking at a solid wagering opportunity.Elimination games are also pivotal as they provide opportunities to take advantage of the desperation of a team that\u2019s up against the wall. If the leading team has won by close margins the public may still overvalue them by emphasizing the series lead rather than a rational analysis of how the games actually played out.Sports Betting Strategies That Don\u2019t WorkThere are several betting systems out there that proclaim to have a secret recipe for foolproof winning. Of course, if they really worked then everyone would be rich and casinos and sportsbooks would be bankrupt. Let\u2019s look at few classic betting systems that aren\u2019t really as awesome as they say they are.Martingale System \u2013 In this system the bettor simply doubles the bet amount after any losing bet in an effort to recoup their money plus a small profit. An obvious problem with this is that any bad losing streak will require a huge amount of money just to get back to even.As well, there aren\u2019t many sportsbooks that would take bets sizes necessary to overcome such a betting system. Another problem is that this system relies on an actual even-money bet which is extremely rare since sportsbook\u2019s charge a 5-10% commission on all bets.The Negative Progression System (a.k.a The d\u2019Alambert System) \u2013 Similar to the Martingale system, with this one you are incrementally raising your bets by equal units after each loss and going back down to the base betting unit after each win.It\u2019s a more moderate version of the Martingale because instead of doubling your bet after a loss, you\u2019re only increasing it by one unit.Compared to the Martingale system which only requires your last bet to win, this system needs your overall winning percentage to out-number your losses.The Labouchere system \u2013 (a.k.a. The Cancellation System) \u2013 This system is also called the split Martingale system. First come up with a base betting unit. Then write down a common Labouchere sequence like 1-1-2-2-1-1. To choose your bet amount, take the first and last numbers from the sequence. In this example, you\u2019d bet two units (1+1).If you lose a bet, add the number of units you bet to the end of the sequence. When you win, cross out the first and last numbers in the sequence. Continue until all numbers in the sequence have been crossed out.The truth is, none of these systems can guarantee a win, even if they promise to do just that. The biggest problems are that sportsbooks don\u2019t offer true even-money bets, you don\u2019t have an infinite bankroll to keep doubling your bet size and the sportsbook has maximum bet amounts to stop you from doubling forever even if your bankroll was unlimited.If sportsbooks are offering deals that seem too good to be true, it's worth double checking if you're legitimate. In general, we advise to sticking to proven and safe betting sites.As we explain in other parts of this guide, the best sports betting strategies are about solid research and analysis, not so-called \u201cguaranteed winning\u201d systems.Using Sports Databases and Stats Sites to Discover TrendsOne of the most important things both savvy punters and oddsmakers utilize is data and trend analysis software. These days there are several online options that offer these services for free or for a low fee. It takes a bit of work to learn to use them at first but once you learn how to use these tools they can be an absolute game-changer for your results.Not only can you figure out how the most common trends are calculated and used, but you can also explore your own trend ideas and potentially find edges that have eluded the sportsbooks and other bettors.You never know what you might find. Perhaps NHL road underdogs, after long homestands, who start their back up goalie in the first game of a back-to-back are much more likely to cover the puckline. It may seem random, but with data analysis tools you can find real trends that can help guide your bets.Advanced Sports Betting StrategiesNow that we\u2019ve covered some of the basics for sports betting strategy and looked at some of the dos and don\u2019ts, let\u2019s take a deeper look into more advanced betting strategies for specific sports.NFL Betting StrategiesWhen you look at historical betting stats it\u2019s pretty incredible how good the oddsmakers are.For example, over the past 13 seasons the underdog has covered the spread 50.3% of the time. This stat is called ATS and stands for \u201cagainst the spread\u201d. It measures how teams perform against the point spread, not just against their opponents. Check out our best NFL picks against the spread to get an advantage over the sportsbooks.That is an incredible stat to ponder. It makes it seem that no matter what strategy you employ, your point spread bet is a coin toss. However, when combining the data with point totals, the number of underdog covers goes up to 53% when the over/under is 34 points or less. That extra three percent represents a massive difference for your bottom line so look for those opportunities at NFL betting sites and apps.One advanced strategy punters use at the start of a new NFL season is the Pythagorean wins strategy, which is a name you might remember from math class in school. Instead of calculating the largest side of a right-angle triangle, though, this method calculates a team\u2019s performance from the previous year.It\u2019s clever because it doesn\u2019t just look at the total wins. It takes into account the amount of points scored by a team and compares it to the number of points scored against them. Amazingly, from 1988 to 2004 the Super Bowl was won 11 out of 16 times by the team that had the highest Pythagorean wins stat, not just the most outright victories.Instead of doing the math yourself, you can find the stats for all teams posted at the beginning of the season. You can also find free calculators online that will do the math for you.This is just one example of a more advanced strategy used to wager on the NFL.

If you\u2019re not sure where you can bet on NFL then check if your state has legal betting on NFL.NBA Betting StrategyIn basketball, one advanced strategy we really like is going against the grain and betting against the public.This works especially well with point totals and teams that put up big numbers at home. The common bettor will remember how a team performs at home, how quick their pace of play is, how many points they give up to the opposition, and then simply bet the same way the next time that team plays at home.Unfortunately for them, they aren\u2019t realizing that the oddsmakers are pushing the line even higher since they know the majority of the betting public is taking the favorite. This means you can often get a great price betting the underdog or the under on totals in these spots.This works especially well when both teams have had busy workloads or are on the tail end of a back-to-back.For more advanced NBA betting strategies, read our full guide on how to bet on the NBA. Check if your state has legal NBA betting on our guide. If it does, head on over to one of the many NBA betting sites and you're good to go.MLB Betting StrategyBaseball is a stat-crazy sport which means there\u2019s a lot of data to dig into for advanced bettors so make sure to dig into spreads and offers provided by various MLB betting sites.Pay close attention to the relationship between the over/under line and how much the underdog pays. Statistics have shown that when a total is higher (8.5 or more) and the game is likely to have a lot of scoring, it favors the underdog in terms of value and the likelihood of an upset. However, this is generally for underdogs of +150 or less who stand a fighting chance of pulling off the minor upset.This is also a viable option when the underdog has lost their previous game and the public is swayed by a small sample size and the odds have increased.For more on baseball betting strategy, check out our full guide on how to bet on the MLB.

It\u2019s relatively low scoring, there are lots of games and lots of teams to choose from. There are also lots of edges for gamblers willing to put in the work.One common example is that the betting public for hockey tends to put too much weight on home ice advantage. As such, even though since 2005 home teams have won nearly 55% of games, because of the odds the ROI over that same period was better for betting on the road teams.The road team\u2019s value gets even bigger when the majority of the public bets on the home team and pushes the moneyline odds even higher on the home side. This creates excellent value for those willing to bet on the road underdog. Statistically speaking the ideal road underdog to look for are ones paying +185 or less as they have historically had the most success winning on the road while having the highest return on investment.For more hockey betting tips and strategies, read our full guide on how to bet on the NHL.What is the Kelly Criterion?The Kelly Criterion is a formula used to calculate how much to bet when the odds are in your favor. The math behind the Kelly Criterion is pretty complicated so we don\u2019t blame you for using a free online calculator to work it out:(BP \u2013 Q)/BB = The decimal odds \u2013 1P = The probability of successQ = The probability of failure \u2013 which equates to (1 \u2013 p)Obviously, in sports betting, it is going to be difficult to know the precise probability of success or failure of an event. However, with research and solid deduction we can make some reasonable guesses and then apply the Kelly Criterion to see how much of our bankroll to bet.Say, for example, that you think the chances of Rafael Nadal beating Roger Federer on Clay are 65:35, and the decimal odds available at your sportsbook are 1.70 for Nadal.Plug those numbers into the formula to determine what percentage of your bankroll to wager.Original formula: (BP-Q)/BOur example: (0.7 * 0.65 \u2013 0.35) / 0.7 = 0.15Therefore the formula suggests a 15% stake on Rafael Nadal.The Best Strategy? Make a Plan and Stick to itThere\u2019s a litany of information out there on different types of sports betting strategies. Some are great quality while others might steer you far wide of your target. The bottom line is, the more you learn about ways to improve your understanding of the sport, teams, players and different kinds of wagers, the more tools you\u2019ll add to your toolbox.The information you gather along the way is really what matters most. As we stated above, it is best to be a master of one field than an average Joe across the board. Find your niche and then develop or employ strategies that work best for that sport and for the teams or players you know best. There\u2019s no need to stretch yourself thin across lots of sports or even lots of teams within the same league.If you\u2019re one of the fortunate Americans living in a state with legalized gambling, be sure to check out our comprehensive list of the best sites available for betting including the best bonuses and deals to get you started.If your state hasn\u2019t legalized sports betting yet, don\u2019t worry.

Unfortunately, there is no such thing. Becoming a successful sports bettor requires hard work, determination, knowledge, and experience. \\nPart of gaining these necessary skills is to learn which strategies to apply and when to implement them. In this article, we\u2019ve compiled 10 quick betting tips and strategies that will move you towards being a stronger, more successful bettor over time. \\nLike anything worth doing, achieving a better sports betting winning percentage takes both time and perseverance. Sports betting is not tantamount to gambling, so we advocate betting with skill, measure, and precision. Don\u2019t leave everything up to luck! \\n1. Manage Your Bankroll and Create a Unit Size\\nIt\u2019s integral that, as a sports bettor, you decide how much money you\u2019re going to dedicate towards betting on sports. Of course, this hinges on your individual financial situation. It\u2019s never wise to bet money that you can\u2019t afford to lose. \\nNow that you\u2019ve established a pre-ordained bankroll, decide on unit size. We recommend that beginner bettors stake 1-5% of their bankroll on every bet they make.\\nThis is undoubtedly the crucial first step in becoming a more successful sport better. Every single \u201csharp\u201d scrutinizes both their bankroll and unit size regularly. For more information, we\u2019ve written a whole guide on sports betting money management.\\xa0On SportsBettingDime, you can find the best sportsbook promo codes so your get that extra bang for your buck across various online sportsbooks.\\n2. Understand Your Risk Tolerance and Goals as a Bettor\\nDifferent types of bettors like to make different bets. The sooner you decide which types of bets you prefer making, the sooner you can perfect your strategy and start winning. \\nSome people like to bet on significant underdogs or highly improbable events. They\u2019re attracted to the longest of long odds. These are the same bettors who are more inclined to create huge parlays and bet on games like Northern Illinois knocking off a top 5 Notre Dame football team in South Bend. OK, bad example. But you get it. \\nOthers have a preference for smaller profits, but more likely outcomes. Betting on heavy favorites and welcoming short odds may not pay out as big, but these bettors are likely to win more often. \\nSome bettors think strategically, with a long-term view of players or teams. These bettors spend a lot of their time and bankroll in the futures marketplace.\\nYou may bet once a week or stay active in sportsbook live betting, placing many bets every day (or even multiple bets on the same event).\\nOf course, none of these types of bets are mutually exclusive. Seasoned sharps are highly active in every single kind of wager, no matter whether it\u2019s got long or short odds attached to it.\\nFocusing on one particular kind of bet is a wise move if you\u2019re looking to improve quickly. \\n3. Develop Realistic Expectations\\nA successful \u201csharp\u201d wins 54% of the time. A historically great \u201csharp\u201d wins at around a 60% clip. These are the best sports bettors in the entire world. \\nWanting to achieve these numbers at the jump or even over an extended period of time is a tall order. We can\u2019t stress this point enough. \\nEven if you win your first 10 bets (which is not unheard of), the law of averages suggests that unfortunately, you\u2019ll come crashing back to the earth at some point. Knowing this and setting realistic expectations can help prevent you from doing anything rash. \\nDon\u2019t deviate from the strategy and methods that made you win 10 in a row in the first place. \\n4. Keep a Record of Your Bets and Review Them Periodically\\nThis strategy might seem unsexy, but it\u2019s nevertheless incredibly important. \\nIt isn\u2019t fun to revisit losses, but if you do, you might prevent yourself from making the same types of mistakes twice. Sometimes, you\u2019ll lose bets even if you\u2019ve done everything right. Other times, you knew you were reaching, but made a bet anyway. Correcting misguided reasoning will benefit your bets in the long run. \\nAn occasional retrospective on your successes and failures will doubtless provide a long-term boost to your bankroll.\\n5. Bet with Your Head, Not Your Heart\\nThe majority of sports bettors began betting because they were sports fans. As such, they probably had allegiance to one or more teams. If this applies to you, we\u2019d recommend from abstaining on betting on any event related to your favorite team (or teams). \\nLoyalty can cloud our judgment, and we recommend being rational and measured in your sports betting. Bias can affect us in both conscious and unconscious ways. For this reason, we recommend skipping lines that you have a personal interest or an emotional investment in.\\n6. Avoid \u201cSunk Cost Fallacy\u201d\\nFor this tip, we\u2019re going to borrow a standard term from behavioral economics. The \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d means that the more time or money one invests in something, that harder it becomes to abandon. This encompasses everything from business investment to a bad relationship.\\nDecisions are colored and tainted by accumulated emotional attachments related to the investment. People engaging in the \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d will throw more money at a project or venture that\u2019s doomed, just because they\u2019ve invested so much time in it already. They simply don\u2019t know when to cut their losses. \\nThis applies to sports betting just as much as it pertains to investments. If you\u2019re having a bad day, cut your losses. And whatever you do, don\u2019t keep upping the size of your bankroll to cover a nasty losing streak.\\n7. Bet on One Sport\\nAs Warren Buffet says, invest in what you know. The same applies to sports betting. \\nIf you\u2019re new to sports betting, it\u2019s worth it to stick to the one sport you know the most about. You\u2019ll already be ahead in the methods you need to get an edge in over the bookmakers, just based on your pre-existing knowledge of how the game is played. \\nYou\u2019ll already know how to evaluate players and teams, and where to gather information about the sport. This is integral to finding the smartest wagers. \\n8. Line Shop for Best Betting Odds\\nLine-shopping is all about taking advantage of pricing discrepancies between the same event at different sportsbooks. Finding the best odds possible is guaranteed to have a significant positive effect on your sports betting ROI. \\nLine shopping is the closest thing to a foolproof, sure-thing strategy in sports betting. It\u2019s guaranteed to net you bigger profits and long-term success in sports betting. The sooner you start doing it, the better. And with dozens of the best sports betting apps available in some states, it\u2019s easier than ever.\\nWe\u2019ve written a full guide on all things line shopping, and why it\u2019s essential.\\n9. Hedge Your Bets When It\u2019s Appropriate\\nAt its core, hedging is a risk management technique that can be applied to sports betting. It\u2019s a way to either reduce your bankroll exposure or lock in a profit on bets. \\nHedging is complicated and beyond the scope of this quick strategy guide, but every hedge you make will be done by betting on a result that\u2019s different than your original wager. \\nRead our detailed guide on how to hedge your bets efficiently.\\n10. Do Your Research and Talk to Other Sports Bettors\\nIn the age of the internet, getting involved in the sports betting community has never been easier. Join sports betting forums, peruse sportsbook-related subreddits, and talk to anyone you know in real life who may be keen on sports betting.\\nNot only will you become more accustomed to sports betting lingo, but you can also exchange sports betting strategies with your friends.\\xa0\\nPatience Is a Virtue\\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned, becoming a successful sports bettor takes time. As you develop more in-depth knowledge and comfort within the sports betting world, you\u2019ll start to see a more significant ROI.\\nRemember, never become a gambler. Everyone has rough days sports betting, but betting responsibly and sticking to a plan will help you remain successful.

Sports are unpredictable by nature and no betting strategy is guaranteed to make money in the long run. But adopting good habits can help maximize your winnings and minimize your losses.

Regardless of how much experience you have, remember that a sound strategy can improve your chances of winning on a consistent basis. These four basic principles will give you a good sports betting foundation:Manage Your BankrollWhen betting on sports, always have a set budget in mind to bet with. This money, referred to as your \u2018bankroll\u2019, is disposable income you can comfortably afford to lose. It may be a small fraction of your monthly income, for example.With a set bankroll in mind, you can then think about stake size. We recommend only making bets with 1-5% of your bankroll as this will help you withstand any spells of bad luck. You can divide your bankroll into betting units to help you do this.A common mistake for a sports bettor on a losing streak is increasing bet size to try and win back their money. This is called \u2018chasing your losses\u2019 and is an incorrect mindset. Chasing losses often results in making irrational decisions and losing even more money.The best way to avoid this is by sticking within your bankroll limits and applying bet management strategies. This will help minimize your losses when you are on a cold streak. Bankroll Example: Let\u2019s say your bankroll for the whole NFL season was $1,000 and you want to bet on 5 NFL games every week:Total bankroll: $1,000Bankroll per week: ($1,000/18) = $55.55Total game units: ($55.55/5) = $11.11In this scenario, your average stake should be $11.11. Therefore, you could stake between $8 \u2013 $12 per game with a $1,000 NFL bankroll.Bet Sober/Don\u2019t TiltThere is a reason why Las Vegas casinos offer free alcoholic drinks to gambling patrons. Betting while under the influence can impair your judgment and lead to irrational decision-making. Avoid being intoxicated if you want to become a winning sports bettor.The second part of this tip refers to \u2019tilt.\u2019 Tilt is a commonly used term in gambling to refer to players who let their emotions take over. Playing while sad, frustrated, scared, or with extremely positive emotions, are all classified as playing with tilt. These emotions often lead to bad decisions.You want to be calm and rational when sports betting. To avoid playing with tilt, take regular breaks and check in with yourself. Take a walk and clear your mind before placing any more bets.Do Your HomeworkYes, sports betting comes with homework! You will want to conduct thorough, high-quality research before placing your bets. Going with a hunch may work every once in a while, but it will not lead to consistent returns over time.To profit from sports betting, look at stats, find trends, create sports betting systems, and analyze past games. Do everything possible to ensure you have value in your pick before placing a wager.Reading opinions from experts can be a great way to catch up on the latest news including key injuries, travel schedules and trades. There are also other tools available to bettors that can help increase your chances of finding good bets. Utilize Free Picks and Prediction Sites Check out these resources next time you are researching which bets to make:Daily Free Picks from sports betting expertsFree Sports Picks daily from state-of-the-art AI softwareBetting Odds CalculatorDon\u2019t Overlook Line ShoppingLastly, get the most out of every bet by shopping for the best possible odds. Check the lines at the best sports betting sites\\xa0to find the highest value. This can be time-consuming, but it\u2019s well worth the effort to find the best potential payout available.Over the course of a sports betting season, you can pocket a lot of extra cash by shopping the lines. We only recommend sites with great odds, but the fluctuating, dynamic nature of these means that no one sportsbook always has the best value. For that reason, line shopping is a must.What\u2019s the Best Sports Betting Strategy?There is no single secret to betting and winning on sports. There are simply too many variables, from different sports and bet types, to different betting styles and bankroll sizes. That said, a combination of multiple betting strategies is usually the most effective.Some sports bettors swear by hedge, parlay and teaser betting, or even sweetheart teasers. However, you should be wary of anyone who claims to have a foolproof sports betting strategy. The perfect strategy doesn\u2019t exist!\\xa0 However, combining sound bankroll management with thorough research and sport-specific strategy offers higher chances of success.

Moneylines are the most popular, but eagle-eyed players will be able to spot when the\\xa0over/under,\\xa0spread\\xa0or\\xa0prop bet\\xa0is a better option. Keep an open mind when reading the lines and don\u2019t be afraid to make different types of bets. Understand Line MovementBetting lines are dynamic. The Patriots might be the -110 favorites at\\xa0NFL betting sites\\xa0today, but big money bets on their opponents could see the odds shift to +120 by tomorrow. Bookmakers move odds to ensure that they will make profit no matter the outcome. Understanding this line movement can help you cash in when you see great odds. Fade The PublicFading the public means to bet against the strong favorites. Betting against popular belief can be risky. But line movement, sporting unpredictability and good odds can make it profitable, too. If you\u2019re looking to fade the public, we\u2019d recommend betting futures early in the season when bookmakers tend to have better odds. Either that or betting on the home underdog. Become An Expert In One Sport FirstAs previously mentioned, a great sports betting strategy requires a sport-specific approach coupled with thorough research. Become an expert in one sport, or even one team, first. Once you\u2019ve developed a method of\\xa0online sports betting\\xa0and have (hopefully) made a little money, you can start to look at betting on other sports too. Don\u2019t Bet With Your HeartBacking your team is one of the greatest joys, but betting with your heart is not a sound sports betting strategy. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a loyal Houston Rockets fan. While you may see the potential and talent within the team, statistically speaking, the squad has been the worst performing team in the NBA throughout 2023. Therefore, placing an\\xa0NBA bet\\xa0on them might not be the best choice. Betting with your personal feelings involved could lead to irrational wagers. Don\u2019t Make Every BetIf you research thoroughly, become an expert, and bet based on the facts, you will be a highly selective bettor. This is to your benefit. Those who bet on a large range of outcomes at the same time are rarely successful in the long term. To increase your chances of success, be picky.Online Betting Strategy Mistakes to AvoidIt\u2019s hard to make money sports betting in the long term, but it does happen. If you have any hopes of being successful, you\u2019ll need to avoid these common betting pitfalls: Not Sticking to Bankroll PlansYour bankroll budget should be a strict cap of only money that you can comfortably afford to lose. From there, you can divide your bankroll up and bet small fractions on each wager. Betting over and above a small amount is high-risk bankroll management. Not Checking Your Betting SlipsBefore you confirm your bet, double and triple check your betting slip. Make sure you\u2019re betting on the right event, outcome, and with odds you\u2019re happy with. Check your stake as well, as it\u2019s easy to add an extra 0 when you\u2019re working quickly. Losing Value on ParlaysParlay bets come with higher odds and a larger house edge, so most professional bettors tend to avoid them. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re keen to cash in on the extra value, it\u2019s particularly important to shop around for top parlay odds. Each bookmaker uses a slightly different odds calculator, so you could miss out on significant value by not finding the best price. Using Inaccurate StatsResearch using independent, respected outlets. Avoid searching for statistics and opinions that will reinforce your beliefs. Instead try to approach each bet objectively. Inaccurate statistics and misinformation (found on fan forums) can contradict official league statistics. Putting Too Much Trust in SystemsNo sports betting system is fool-proof. For that reason, never follow one blindly. Keep track of your profit and loss, and check in regularly to see how the system is working out for you. Don\u2019t be afraid to change up your habits if you need to. Having Unrealistic ExpectationsVery few people make a significant amount of money through sports betting in the long run. We encourage all bettors to see it as a form of entertainment, rather than a moneymaker. Keep realistic expectations with regards to your betting strategy, and remember that Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.Key Takeaways for Sports Betting StrategyUltimately, it\u2019ll be up to you to determine which strategies work best for your style of play. The baseline for a successful betting strategy should always be some combination of bankroll management and research. If you\u2019d truly like to win more bets, you\u2019ll need to put in the work and choose a field of sports betting to study and work towards a goal.With these tips and strategies, you should have a great foundation to build off and learn more about sports betting.

Check out our crash course in betting odds to get up to speed.Have a betting bankroll \u2013\\xa0We\u2019ll go into more detail later but we can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to maintain a separate bankroll for betting.Diversify your action \u2013\\xa0It\u2019s always better to spread your money out over more bets to help overcome bad luck and reduce variance.Avoid longshots and parlays \u2013\\xa0When you get a bigger bankroll it\u2019s okay to make a few longshot bets but when you\u2019re starting out they\u2019ll be a big drain.Bet the underdog \u2013\\xa0One of the most common edges you can find is when a popular team is overhyped. Bet the underdog for better value and a bigger payout.Key Beginner ConceptsAs a beginner, it\u2019s important to focus on the basics. Once you learn good fundamentals you can take on more complicated bets.To get you started, here are some quick and easy basic strategies to hardwire into the sports betting circuits of your brain.Focus on One TeamThis is a simple idea but it\u2019s more powerful than you might think. It is much more valuable to be an expert on one team than have an average amount of knowledge on many teams. The more you know about a specific team the better you\u2019ll be able to understand good value when you check the newest betting odds.As an expert on your team you will be in-the-know in terms of any important news and if you are able to spot something before bookmakers can change lines you can gain value. This is especially true in smaller non-marquee leagues.If one team is too restricting, at least limit yourself to betting on just one league.Study Teams\u2019 Records Against the SpreadA common stat you\u2019ll see a lot is called \u201cATS\u201d which stands for \u201cagainst the spread\u201d.It is extremely valuable to know how teams perform not just in the win/loss column but also against the point spread created by casinos and sportsbooks. Think of the point spread like a secondary competition for teams when it comes to gambling.Teams are looking to get as many straight-up wins as possible but for gambling purposes it\u2019s also really important to understand how they performed compared to the oddsmakers\u2019 expectations, not just their opponents. This is referred to as a team\u2019s ATS stat.If a team is beating the spread more than half the time on average, it\u2019s a great opportunity for you to bet on.Respect Bankroll ManagementThis concept will pay off in any activity where you\u2019re making decisions about how to invest your money. In short, it\u2019s not just about the teams you bet on but the amount and frequency of your bets too.Good bankroll management is all about protecting yourself from the inevitable cold streaks that come with any kind of gambling from time to time. The first step is creating a betting bankroll that\u2019s separate from your regular day to day money.If your sports betting bankroll is over $200, your average single bet size should be about 2% of your total roll. Any roll that is below $200 should stick to a maximum $5 bet size. It\u2019s always better to make more bets with a smaller percentage of your roll riding on each bet.These might sound like small numbers but if you want to grow your roll over time and avoid going broke, this is the way to do it.If you\u2019re not yet listening to the Wise Kracks podcast, you should definitely do so! Bill Krackomberger is a strong advocate for good bankroll management.

To put it in non-gambling terms, if one store is charging you more for bread than the one down the street, you\u2019d be a fool not to go with the cheaper option. The catch is that you have to shop around to find the best deals.The same holds true for sports bets. If you are diligent about\\xa0shopping lines you can find better value on your bets.Also, by virtue of the fact that you will need to create different accounts at different books you will have the opportunity to take advantage of the different promotional offers upon sign-up and first deposit. Besides that, discover the best sports betting mobile apps and top-rated sports betting sites to get started.Ride Winning StreaksTeam and player performance in sports can be really streaky. Sometimes players are in the zone and can\u2019t miss a shot while other times they\u2019re as cold as ice. You can take advantage of hot and cold streaks in your betting and if you can identify them faster than the oddsmakers, it presents a big opportunity.What is important to remember is making sure the odds are offering the right value and you\u2019re evaluating all the factors accurately. If a team beats a series of lower quality teams while playing at home it may not be the right time to jump on the bandwagon when their next game is on the road against a top opponent, for example.Keep track of the schedule and factors that can help keep a streak alive. Also, if you are looking to take them on a spread rather than moneyline, check to see how they\u2019ve been faring against the spread in recent games.Sports Betting Strategies That WorkNow that we\u2019ve covered some of the basic building blocks of what is required for a strong sports betting strategy, let\u2019s look at some specific examples of wagering techniques that have been proven to work when properly applied.Hedging Your BetsThere are opportunities in sports betting where a punter can make a bet that is opposite to his original bet. It might seem weird to bet against your original bet but as you\u2019ll see, when it\u2019s done right it can guarantee you a profit.Hedging usually applies to futures bets where the odds on your bet change significantly in your favor as the season progresses, or in big parlays when you\u2019ve won a large number of your bets but still have one or more wagers left to play.In both these examples you can bet against your original wager and lock in a profit, regardless of the final outcome.Hedging lets you sacrifice a larger potential payout in exchange for reduced risk and a guaranteed profit. By making your hedge bet larger or smaller you can play with how much risk and reward you want to take.Let\u2019s take a closer look at how hedge betting works and use a famous example from the 2011 MLB season.At a Las Vegas sportsbook, a St. Louis fan made $250 wager on the Cardinals to win the World Series. At the time the Cardinals were five games out of a playoff spot with 15 games to play. A big hill to climb to even just make the playoffs.He put $250 on the Cardinals to win the world series.The bet paid 1000:1 for a potential $250,000 profit.As luck would have it, his prognostications came true and the Cardinals not only made the playoffs but won the National League Championship Series (NLCS) and a trip to the World Series to play the Texas Rangers.The gambler was now looking at a potentially massive payday. But what if the Cardinals lost the World Series. He would get exactly zero. This is the perfect opportunity to hedge. By betting opposite to the original wager, he can lock in a profit. Let\u2019s see how.Let\u2019s assume for this example that a bet on the Texas Rangers to win the World Series paid 1:1. If the gambler was able to raise $125,000 and bet it on the Rangers he would guarantee himself a $125,000 profit regardless of who ends up winning.A Cardinals World Series win gives him $250,000 on his first ticket, minus the $125,000 he bet on the Rangers.If the Cardinals lose he wins $125,000 from his bet on the Rangers.Hedging also works the same way when you\u2019ve made a multiple bet parlay and you\u2019ve won most of your bets. With parlays one loss is all it takes to lose the entire parlay. If there\u2019s just one game to go, consider hedging by betting against your original parlay bet to lock in a profit.Betting the MiddleThis process, also known as middling, is when a punter makes an early point spread bet only to see the line move later. Sometimes you\u2019ll also find middling opportunities when you\u2019re line shopping and discover a significantly different point spread for the same game.By exploiting the line change you can place an opposite bet to your first wager and sometimes win them both. If that sounds confusing, don\u2019t worry. Keep reading for an example to make it really clear.In this example, you make a point spread bet on a team that\u2019s listed with a spread of -7 in an NFL game in the middle of the week.After you\u2019ve made your bet, you see the point spread move to -10 on game day. This can happen for a few different reasons including too much action being placed on the underdog by the betting public or by things like injuries or other player factors.To bet the middle in this example, you can now place a bet on the +10 underdog.If the favorite wins by 8 or 9 points exactly, you win both your bets. Essentially you are hoping to hit the \u201cmiddle\u201d of the two wagers.You also have insurance because if the final winning margin doesn\u2019t fall in the \u201cmiddle\u201d of your bets, one bet will win and the other will lose, effectively canceling each other out.The downside is that you will take a small loss when this happens due to the commission (vig) charged by the sportsbook.Read our full guide to betting the middle for more information.Betting Against the PublicThis strategy is also called \u2018fading the public\u2019 and it simply means betting opposite to the majority of the betting public. You might also hear this called \u201cbetting against the public underdog\u201d because the majority of the public usually bets on the favorite.The main concept to absorb here is that oddsmakers don\u2019t set odds and lines based solely on what they think the game\u2019s outcome will be. Sportsbooks also want to attract roughly equal action on both sides of a bet to protect themselves from a potentially massive loss.Often the majority of the public bets on the favorite, or the team that\u2019s getting hyped up the most by the media. Since everyone\u2019s betting on the favorite, the sportsbook has to move the line in favor of the underdogs to make them more appealing so more people will bet on them.Being able to identify cases when the public is pushing a line gives smart bettors an edge because the line is moving relative to the money coming in rather than the likely final score of the game. As such, you can bet in the opposite direction and reap the benefit of extra points in your favor on the point spread or extra pennies on the dollar with the moneyline.To fade the public you need to pay close attention to line movements. When you see a line move in favor of the underdog it\u2019s a good sign that the majority of the public is taking the favorite. There are also free resources online that can tell you the distribution of action on specific bets.Zig Zag TheoryThe\\xa0zig zag betting theory is a strategy that applies to betting on NHL and NBA playoff series. This is because those leagues use a 2-2-1-1-1 playoff format when it comes to home and away games.The higher seeded team plays at home for the first two games, as well as the 5th and 7th, if necessary.The zig zag theory works on two main concepts. First, home teams have a real advantage. Second, when a team is coming off a loss they generally play harder and have a statistically better chance of winning. The zig zag theory works best when a team is at home AND coming off a loss.Let\u2019s look at the best examples of when to use the zig zag theory:The theory holds that if the road team loses the first two games, they are generally a strong bet to win game 3, especially in the NBA where no team has ever come back from a 0-3 game deficit and so the urgency to win game 3 at home will be enough to carry them to victoryIn NBA playoffs, when the home team loses game 1 they have historically taken game two 75% of the time.In the NHL the historical percentages are different and even when the home team takes game 1, the lower seed comes back to win game 2 on the road one-third of the time. In these moments, with the public betting heavily on the home team to replicate their game 1 success, look to find great value on the road squad. If the value is greater than 33% you\u2019re looking at a solid wagering opportunity.Elimination games are also pivotal as they provide opportunities to take advantage of the desperation of a team that\u2019s up against the wall. If the leading team has won by close margins the public may still overvalue them by emphasizing the series lead rather than a rational analysis of how the games actually played out.Sports Betting Strategies That Don\u2019t WorkThere are several betting systems out there that proclaim to have a secret recipe for foolproof winning. Of course, if they really worked then everyone would be rich and casinos and sportsbooks would be bankrupt. Let\u2019s look at few classic betting systems that aren\u2019t really as awesome as they say they are.Martingale System \u2013 In this system the bettor simply doubles the bet amount after any losing bet in an effort to recoup their money plus a small profit. An obvious problem with this is that any bad losing streak will require a huge amount of money just to get back to even.As well, there aren\u2019t many sportsbooks that would take bets sizes necessary to overcome such a betting system. Another problem is that this system relies on an actual even-money bet which is extremely rare since sportsbook\u2019s charge a 5-10% commission on all bets.The Negative Progression System (a.k.a The d\u2019Alambert System) \u2013 Similar to the Martingale system, with this one you are incrementally raising your bets by equal units after each loss and going back down to the base betting unit after each win.It\u2019s a more moderate version of the Martingale because instead of doubling your bet after a loss, you\u2019re only increasing it by one unit.Compared to the Martingale system which only requires your last bet to win, this system needs your overall winning percentage to out-number your losses.The Labouchere system \u2013 (a.k.a. The Cancellation System) \u2013 This system is also called the split Martingale system. First come up with a base betting unit. Then write down a common Labouchere sequence like 1-1-2-2-1-1. To choose your bet amount, take the first and last numbers from the sequence. In this example, you\u2019d bet two units (1+1).If you lose a bet, add the number of units you bet to the end of the sequence. When you win, cross out the first and last numbers in the sequence. Continue until all numbers in the sequence have been crossed out.The truth is, none of these systems can guarantee a win, even if they promise to do just that. The biggest problems are that sportsbooks don\u2019t offer true even-money bets, you don\u2019t have an infinite bankroll to keep doubling your bet size and the sportsbook has maximum bet amounts to stop you from doubling forever even if your bankroll was unlimited.If sportsbooks are offering deals that seem too good to be true, it's worth double checking if you're legitimate. In general, we advise to sticking to proven and safe betting sites.As we explain in other parts of this guide, the best sports betting strategies are about solid research and analysis, not so-called \u201cguaranteed winning\u201d systems.Using Sports Databases and Stats Sites to Discover TrendsOne of the most important things both savvy punters and oddsmakers utilize is data and trend analysis software. These days there are several online options that offer these services for free or for a low fee. It takes a bit of work to learn to use them at first but once you learn how to use these tools they can be an absolute game-changer for your results.Not only can you figure out how the most common trends are calculated and used, but you can also explore your own trend ideas and potentially find edges that have eluded the sportsbooks and other bettors.You never know what you might find. Perhaps NHL road underdogs, after long homestands, who start their back up goalie in the first game of a back-to-back are much more likely to cover the puckline. It may seem random, but with data analysis tools you can find real trends that can help guide your bets.Advanced Sports Betting StrategiesNow that we\u2019ve covered some of the basics for sports betting strategy and looked at some of the dos and don\u2019ts, let\u2019s take a deeper look into more advanced betting strategies for specific sports.NFL Betting StrategiesWhen you look at historical betting stats it\u2019s pretty incredible how good the oddsmakers are.For example, over the past 13 seasons the underdog has covered the spread 50.3% of the time. This stat is called ATS and stands for \u201cagainst the spread\u201d. It measures how teams perform against the point spread, not just against their opponents. Check out our best NFL picks against the spread to get an advantage over the sportsbooks.That is an incredible stat to ponder. It makes it seem that no matter what strategy you employ, your point spread bet is a coin toss. However, when combining the data with point totals, the number of underdog covers goes up to 53% when the over/under is 34 points or less. That extra three percent represents a massive difference for your bottom line so look for those opportunities at NFL betting sites and apps.One advanced strategy punters use at the start of a new NFL season is the Pythagorean wins strategy, which is a name you might remember from math class in school. Instead of calculating the largest side of a right-angle triangle, though, this method calculates a team\u2019s performance from the previous year.It\u2019s clever because it doesn\u2019t just look at the total wins. It takes into account the amount of points scored by a team and compares it to the number of points scored against them. Amazingly, from 1988 to 2004 the Super Bowl was won 11 out of 16 times by the team that had the highest Pythagorean wins stat, not just the most outright victories.Instead of doing the math yourself, you can find the stats for all teams posted at the beginning of the season. You can also find free calculators online that will do the math for you.This is just one example of a more advanced strategy used to wager on the NFL.

If you\u2019re not sure where you can bet on NFL then check if your state has legal betting on NFL.NBA Betting StrategyIn basketball, one advanced strategy we really like is going against the grain and betting against the public.This works especially well with point totals and teams that put up big numbers at home. The common bettor will remember how a team performs at home, how quick their pace of play is, how many points they give up to the opposition, and then simply bet the same way the next time that team plays at home.Unfortunately for them, they aren\u2019t realizing that the oddsmakers are pushing the line even higher since they know the majority of the betting public is taking the favorite. This means you can often get a great price betting the underdog or the under on totals in these spots.This works especially well when both teams have had busy workloads or are on the tail end of a back-to-back.For more advanced NBA betting strategies, read our full guide on how to bet on the NBA. Check if your state has legal NBA betting on our guide. If it does, head on over to one of the many NBA betting sites and you're good to go.MLB Betting StrategyBaseball is a stat-crazy sport which means there\u2019s a lot of data to dig into for advanced bettors so make sure to dig into spreads and offers provided by various MLB betting sites.Pay close attention to the relationship between the over/under line and how much the underdog pays. Statistics have shown that when a total is higher (8.5 or more) and the game is likely to have a lot of scoring, it favors the underdog in terms of value and the likelihood of an upset. However, this is generally for underdogs of +150 or less who stand a fighting chance of pulling off the minor upset.This is also a viable option when the underdog has lost their previous game and the public is swayed by a small sample size and the odds have increased.For more on baseball betting strategy, check out our full guide on how to bet on the MLB.

It\u2019s relatively low scoring, there are lots of games and lots of teams to choose from. There are also lots of edges for gamblers willing to put in the work.One common example is that the betting public for hockey tends to put too much weight on home ice advantage. As such, even though since 2005 home teams have won nearly 55% of games, because of the odds the ROI over that same period was better for betting on the road teams.The road team\u2019s value gets even bigger when the majority of the public bets on the home team and pushes the moneyline odds even higher on the home side. This creates excellent value for those willing to bet on the road underdog. Statistically speaking the ideal road underdog to look for are ones paying +185 or less as they have historically had the most success winning on the road while having the highest return on investment.For more hockey betting tips and strategies, read our full guide on how to bet on the NHL.What is the Kelly Criterion?The Kelly Criterion is a formula used to calculate how much to bet when the odds are in your favor. The math behind the Kelly Criterion is pretty complicated so we don\u2019t blame you for using a free online calculator to work it out:(BP \u2013 Q)/BB = The decimal odds \u2013 1P = The probability of successQ = The probability of failure \u2013 which equates to (1 \u2013 p)Obviously, in sports betting, it is going to be difficult to know the precise probability of success or failure of an event. However, with research and solid deduction we can make some reasonable guesses and then apply the Kelly Criterion to see how much of our bankroll to bet.Say, for example, that you think the chances of Rafael Nadal beating Roger Federer on Clay are 65:35, and the decimal odds available at your sportsbook are 1.70 for Nadal.Plug those numbers into the formula to determine what percentage of your bankroll to wager.Original formula: (BP-Q)/BOur example: (0.7 * 0.65 \u2013 0.35) / 0.7 = 0.15Therefore the formula suggests a 15% stake on Rafael Nadal.The Best Strategy? Make a Plan and Stick to itThere\u2019s a litany of information out there on different types of sports betting strategies. Some are great quality while others might steer you far wide of your target. The bottom line is, the more you learn about ways to improve your understanding of the sport, teams, players and different kinds of wagers, the more tools you\u2019ll add to your toolbox.The information you gather along the way is really what matters most. As we stated above, it is best to be a master of one field than an average Joe across the board. Find your niche and then develop or employ strategies that work best for that sport and for the teams or players you know best. There\u2019s no need to stretch yourself thin across lots of sports or even lots of teams within the same league.If you\u2019re one of the fortunate Americans living in a state with legalized gambling, be sure to check out our comprehensive list of the best sites available for betting including the best bonuses and deals to get you started.If your state hasn\u2019t legalized sports betting yet, don\u2019t worry.
