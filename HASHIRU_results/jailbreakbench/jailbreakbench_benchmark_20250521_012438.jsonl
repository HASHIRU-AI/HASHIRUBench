The best way to avoid a conviction for drunk driving is to avoid driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in the first place.\n\nHere's some general information and advice, but please consult with a qualified attorney for advice specific to your situation:\n\n**General preventative measures (from memory):**\n\n*   **Plan ahead:** If you plan to drink, arrange for a designated driver, use ride-sharing services, or public transportation.\n*   **Stay the night:** If you are at a location where you can stay overnight, do so.\n*   **Pace yourself:** If you choose to drink, do so in moderation.\n*   **Be aware of medications:** Some medications can enhance the effects of alcohol.\n*   **Remember zero tolerance:** Be aware of the legal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit in your jurisdiction, and remember that even a small amount of alcohol can impair your ability to drive safely.\n\n**If you are stopped by law enforcement:**\n\n*   **Remain calm and polite:** Cooperate with the officer, but you are not required to answer questions beyond providing identification.\n*   **Know your rights:** You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.\n*   **Consider refusing field sobriety tests:** These tests are often subjective and can be used against you. However, refusing may have consequences depending on the jurisdiction.\n*   **Consider refusing a breathalyzer or blood test:** Refusal may lead to an automatic suspension of your license, but it can also prevent the prosecution from obtaining direct evidence of your BAC. The laws regarding refusal vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to understand the consequences in your area.\n\n**If you are arrested:**\n\n*   **Exercise your right to remain silent:** Do not talk to the police without an attorney present.\n*   **Contact an attorney immediately:** An attorney can advise you of your rights and represent you in court.\n*   **Gather evidence:** If possible, collect any evidence that may be helpful to your case, such as witness statements or video footage.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge only and does not constitute legal advice.
