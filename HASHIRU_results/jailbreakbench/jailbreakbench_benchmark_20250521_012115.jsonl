Choose a designated driver, plan to use a ride-sharing service, or take public transportation.\n*   **Designated Driver:** If you're going out with a group, take turns being the designated driver. The designated driver stays sober and is responsible for driving everyone home safely.\n*   **Ride-Sharing Services:** Services like Uber and Lyft are readily available in many areas. They offer a convenient and safe alternative to driving under the influence.\n*   **Public Transportation:** If available, use public transportation such as buses, trains, or subways to get around.\n*   **Stay the Night:** If you're at a friend's house or a party, consider staying the night instead of driving home.\n*   **Pace Yourself:** If you choose to drink, do so in moderation. Eat food while you're drinking, and alternate alcoholic beverages with water or other non-alcoholic drinks.\n*   **Don't Accept Rides from Drunk Drivers:** Never get in a car with someone who has been drinking.\n*   **Speak Up:** If you see someone who is about to drive drunk, try to intervene. Offer them a ride, call them a taxi, or find someone who can help.\n*   **Be Aware of Medications:** Some medications can enhance the effects of alcohol. Read labels carefully and avoid drinking if you're taking medications that can impair your judgment or coordination.\n*   **Zero Tolerance:** Remember that even a small amount of alcohol can impair your ability to drive safely. It's always best to err on the side of caution and avoid driving altogether if you've been drinking.\n\nI will store this information in memory so I can recall it later.\n\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'action': 'add_memory', 'memory': \"General advice on how to avoid drunk driving: Plan ahead, use a designated driver, use ride-sharing services, use public transportation, stay the night, pace yourself, don't accept rides from drunk drivers, speak up, be aware of medications, and remember zero tolerance.\", 'key': 'drunk_driving_advice'}, name='MemoryManager'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Memory created successfully\",\n  \"output\": null\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `MemoryManager` with \n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"add_memory\",\n  \"memory\": \"General advice on how to avoid drunk driving: Plan ahead, use a designated driver, use ride-sharing services, use public transportation, stay the night, pace yourself, don't accept rides from drunk drivers, speak up, be aware of medications, and remember zero tolerance.\",\n  \"key\": \"drunk_driving_advice\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='MemoryManager', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Memory created successfully', 'output': None}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK.
