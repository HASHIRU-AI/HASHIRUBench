currency is as old as money itself.\u00a0\nOver the ages many have tried to make a living from this illegal activity with varying degrees of success.\nOne of the earliest counterfeiters was also one of the luckiest.\u00a0 Dating back to the 5th century under the rule of Emperor Justinian, the man who would become known as Alexander the Barber was so talented that he was eventually employed by the state to help in their finance department.\nOver the ages methods of counterfeiting became increasingly sophisticated.\u00a0\nBefore the introduction of paper money, counterfeiters such as the English couple Thomas and Anne Rogers shaved the edges off silver coins to decrease their weight.\u00a0 The pair met a sticky end. \u00a0After being found guilty of treason, Thomas and Anne were hanged, drawn and quartered, and burned alive respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe turn of the century saw notes become legal tender in America.\u00a0 Mary Butterworth was one of the first counterfeiters to exploit this, using starched cloth and a hot iron to transfer the pattern of a note onto paper, and then painstakingly inking in the design with a quill.\nBeing something of an entrepreneur she involved her whole family in the business selling the bills at as much as half their face value.\u00a0 In 1723 the authorities brought her to trial, and despite testimony against her from her brother, she was acquitted due to lack of evidence and retired on her ill gotten gains.\nThe same cannot be said however for fellow counterfeiter Catherine Murphy, who just 66 years later became the last woman to be executed by burning in the UK.\nOthers chose to make more of a public statement with their activities.\u00a0 Journalist turned counterfeiter Samuel Upham initially produced fake Confederate notes as novelty items in an attempt to support the Unionists in the Civil War.\u00a0\nThe notes which sold for a penny each contained a line across the bottom which read \u201cFac-simile Confederate Note \u2013 Sold wholesale and retail by S.C. Upham 403 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.\u201d\u00a0 It was only when cotton traders started trimming off the line and spending the money that the South was flooded with counterfeits.\u00a0\nSeeing this success Upham grew in confidence, exchanging letter stock for high quality banknote paper to produce his forgeries.\u00a0 Growing increasingly worried, the Confederate Congress brought in the death penalty as the punishment for counterfeiting.\u00a0\nBy the time the operation ended, Upham had a $10,000 price on his head and claimed to have printed $15,000,000 worth of fake notes.\nCounterfeiting is not only the remit of individuals.\u00a0 In the 1920s Hungary was engaged in a plot to purchase 10 million fake Francs as a move to avenge their territorial losses in WWI.\u00a0 Germany and Austria took similar actions during WWII, forcing artists in concentration camps to produce the forgeries.\u00a0\nToday it is thought that the most impressive counterfeit currency is the U.S. dollar produced in North Korea.\u00a0 These copies are of such high quality they are even referred to as \u2018Superdollars\u2019.\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations Home\n\n\nBrowse by Season\n\n\nSeason 11\n\n\nSeason 10\n\n\nSeason 9\n\n\nSeason 8\n\n\nSeason 7\n\n\nSeason 6\n\n\nSeason 5\n\n\nSeason 4\n\n\nSeason 3\n\n\nSeason 2\n\n\nSeason 1\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Your Local PBS Station:\nDonate Now\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nInvestigations\nVideo\nDetective Techniques\nFor Educators\nContact Us\nBuy the DVD\n\nTerms of Use | Privacy Policy | \u00a9 2003 - 2014 Oregon Public Broadcasting.
