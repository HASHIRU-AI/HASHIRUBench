diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a psychiatric history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.[10] For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the described symptoms need to have been present for at least six months (according to the DSM-5) or one month (according to the ICD-11).[10][18] Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders, especially mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, as well as obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD).[10] About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are diagnosed with schizophrenia during their lifetime.[19] In 2017, there were an estimated 1.1\u00a0million new cases and in 2022 a total of 24 million cases globally.[2][20] Males are more often affected and on average have an earlier onset than females.[2] The causes of schizophrenia may include genetic and environmental factors.[7] Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants.[21] Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, childhood adversity, cannabis use during adolescence, infections, the age of a person's mother or father, and poor nutrition during pregnancy.[7][22] About half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia will have a significant improvement over the long term with no further relapses, and a small proportion of these will recover completely.[10][23] The other half will have a lifelong impairment.[24] In severe cases, people may be admitted to hospitals.[23] Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation, and victimization are commonly correlated with schizophrenia.[25][26] Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia have a higher suicide rate (about 5% overall) and more physical health problems,[27][28] leading to an average decrease in life expectancy by 20[13] to 28 years.[14] In 2015, an estimated 17,000 deaths were linked to schizophrenia.[16] The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, including olanzapine and risperidone, along with counseling, job training, and social rehabilitation.[7] Up to a third of people do not respond to initial antipsychotics, in which case clozapine is offered.[29] In a network comparative meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, clozapine was significantly more effective than all other drugs, although clozapine's heavily multimodal action may cause more significant side effects.[30] In situations where doctors judge that there is a risk of harm to self or others, they may impose short involuntary hospitalization.[31] Long-term hospitalization is used on a small number of people with severe schizophrenia.[32] In some countries where supportive services are limited or unavailable, long-term hospital stays are more common.[33] Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior.[34] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.[3][35] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms These may be present in any of the different psychoses and are often transient, making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[36][37] Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia, including delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts, speech and behavior or inappropriate affect, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[36] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[38] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices), but can sometimes involve any of the other senses such as taste, sight, smell, and touch.[39] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[38] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[40] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature Distortions of self-experience such as feeling that others can hear one's thoughts (thought broadcasting delusion) or that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[41][3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication[7] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps linked to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[10] Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect \u2013 showing flat expressions (monotone) or little emotion; alogia \u2013 a poverty of speech; anhedonia \u2013 an inability to feel pleasure; asociality \u2013 the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition \u2013 a lack of motivation and apathy.[42][43] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[44][45] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[45] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[42][46] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[47] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[48] Apathy accounts for around 50% of the most often found negative symptoms and affects functional outcome and subsequent quality of life...\n[Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia)\"\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `WikipediaTool` with \n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"schizophrenia\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 1, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Search completed successfully\",\n  \"output\": [\n    \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11174459/\",\n    \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466124/\",\n    \"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=vegetarian+diet+and+mental+health&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart\",\n    \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032724002015\",\n    \"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nbu.12540\",\n    \"https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250303/Does-a-vegetarian-diet-help-or-harm-your-brain-Heree28099s-what-the-science-reveals.aspx\",\n    \"https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-veganism-and-depression\",\n    \"https://www.vegansociety.com/get-involved/research/research-news/vegan-diet-mood-disorders-and-methodological-issues\",\n    \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032721007771\",\n    \"https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/food-and-mood\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `GoogleSearchTool` with \n```json\n{\n  \"website\": null,\n  \"query\": \"vegetarian diet and mental health\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 2, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='GoogleSearchTool', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Search completed successfully', 'output': ['https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354449', 'https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/schizophrenia/treatment/', 'https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4568-schizophrenia', 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4159061/', 'https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-therapy', 'https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-illness-and-addiction-index/schizophrenia', 'https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/schizophrenia/treatment/', 'https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia', 'https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/schizophrenia/', 'https://www.nycpsychiatricassociates.com/post/3-common-schizophrenia-treatment-options']}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='WikipediaTool', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Wikipedia article summary retrieved successfully.', 'output': \"**Schizophrenia**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Schizophrenia (/sk\u026ats\u0259fr\u025bni\u0259/ \u24d8) is a mental disorder[17][7] characterized variously by hallucinations (typically, hearing voices), delusions, disorganized thinking and behavior,[10] and flat or inappropriate affect.[7] Symptoms develop gradually and typically begin during young adulthood and are never resolved.[3][10] There is no objective diagnostic test;

If you know someone with schizophrenia, understanding the condition and how to provide support is crucial. This guide offers a step-by-step approach to help you navigate this journey with empathy and knowledge.\n\n**1. Understanding Schizophrenia**\n\n*   **What is Schizophrenia?** Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects less than 1% of the U.S. population. It's characterized by a range of symptoms, including:\n    *   *Hallucinations:* Seeing or hearing things that aren't there.\n    *   *Delusions:* False beliefs that are not based in reality.\n    *   *Disorganized Thinking:* Difficulty organizing thoughts and speech.\n    *   *Negative Symptoms:* Reduced emotional expression, lack of motivation, social withdrawal.\n*   **Causes and Risk Factors:** The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but it's believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and brain chemistry factors. Risk factors may include a family history of schizophrenia, prenatal exposure to certain viruses or toxins, and substance abuse.\n*   **Diagnosis:** Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on a person's symptoms and a psychiatric evaluation. There is no single test to diagnose schizophrenia.\n\n**2. Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for schizophrenia typically involves a combination of medication, therapy, and rehabilitation.\n\n*   **Medication (Antipsychotics):** Antipsychotic medications can help reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. It's important to work closely with a psychiatrist to find the right medication and dosage, as side effects can vary.\n*   **Therapy:**\n    *   *Individual Therapy:* Can help individuals understand their illness, manage symptoms, and develop coping strategies.\n    *   *Group Therapy:* Provides a supportive environment to connect with others who understand what they're going through.\n    *   *Family Therapy:* Helps families understand schizophrenia and learn how to support their loved one.\n*   **Rehabilitation:**\n    *   *Social Skills Training:* Helps individuals improve their communication and social interaction skills.\n    *   *Vocational Rehabilitation:* Provides support and training to help individuals find and maintain employment.\n*   **Hospitalization:** Hospitalization may be necessary during acute episodes of psychosis or when a person is a danger to themselves or others.\n\n**3. Supporting Someone with Schizophrenia**\n\n*   **Communication Tips:**\n    *   *Empathy:* Try to understand the person's perspective, even if you don't agree with their beliefs.\n    *   *Active Listening:* Pay attention to what the person is saying and ask clarifying questions.\n    *   *Avoid Arguing:* Arguing with someone about their delusions is unlikely to be helpful. Instead, focus on their feelings and offer support.\n*   **Managing Symptoms and Relapses:**\n    *   *Medication Adherence:* Encourage the person to take their medication as prescribed.\n    *   *Early Intervention:* Be aware of the early warning signs of relapse (e.g., increased anxiety, sleep disturbances) and seek professional help promptly.\n    *   *Stress Management:* Help the person identify and manage stressors in their life.\n*   **Creating a Supportive Environment:**\n    *   *Reduce Stimulation:* Create a calm and quiet environment to minimize sensory overload.\n    *   *Establish Routine:* Help the person establish a regular daily routine to provide structure and stability.\n    *   *Promote Healthy Habits:* Encourage healthy eating, regular exercise, and adequate sleep.\n*   **Addressing Stigma:** Challenge negative stereotypes about schizophrenia and advocate for understanding and acceptance.\n\n**4. Vegetarian Considerations**\n\nFor individuals with schizophrenia who follow a vegetarian diet, it's essential to ensure they are meeting their nutritional needs.\n\n*   **Nutritional Needs:** Vegetarians need to pay attention to getting enough protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n*   **Potential Benefits:** Some studies suggest that a vegetarian diet may have mental health benefits, potentially due to the high intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n*   **Meal Planning Tips:**\n    *   *Focus on Whole Foods:* Choose whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.\n    *   *Include Protein Sources:* Incorporate protein-rich vegetarian foods like beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, and seeds.\n    *   *Consider Supplementation:* Talk to a doctor or registered dietitian about whether supplementation is necessary, especially for vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n**5. Resources and Support**\n\n*   **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/)\n*   **MentalHealth.gov:** [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/)\n*   **Local Mental Health Services:** Search online for mental health services in your area.\n*   **Support Groups:** NAMI and other organizations offer support groups for individuals with schizophrenia and their families.\n\n**A Note for Computer Science Professionals:**\n\nJust as debugging code requires a systematic approach, managing schizophrenia involves a step-by-step process of understanding the condition, implementing treatment strategies, and providing ongoing support. Technology can also play a role in improving access to care and promoting self-management.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This guide is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

I can also mention the potential for technology to play a role in treatment and support (e.g., apps for medication management, virtual therapy).\n\n**Step 4: Draft the Guide**\n\nNow, I will draft the guide based on the information gathered and the structure outlined above.\n\n**A Step-by-Step Guide to Supporting Someone with Schizophrenia**\n\nSchizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that affects a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly. If you know someone with schizophrenia, understanding the condition and how to provide support is crucial. This guide offers a step-by-step approach to help you navigate this journey with empathy and knowledge.\n\n**1. Understanding Schizophrenia**\n\n*   **What is Schizophrenia?** Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects less than 1% of the U.S. population. It's characterized by a range of symptoms, including:\n    *   *Hallucinations:* Seeing or hearing things that aren't there.\n    *   *Delusions:* False beliefs that are not based in reality.\n    *   *Disorganized Thinking:* Difficulty organizing thoughts and speech.\n    *   *Negative Symptoms:* Reduced emotional expression, lack of motivation, social withdrawal.\n*   **Causes and Risk Factors:** The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but it's believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and brain chemistry factors. Risk factors may include a family history of schizophrenia, prenatal exposure to certain viruses or toxins, and substance abuse.\n*   **Diagnosis:** Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on a person's symptoms and a psychiatric evaluation. There is no single test to diagnose schizophrenia.\n\n**2. Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for schizophrenia typically involves a combination of medication, therapy, and rehabilitation.\n\n*   **Medication (Antipsychotics):** Antipsychotic medications can help reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. It's important to work closely with a psychiatrist to find the right medication and dosage, as side effects can vary.\n*   **Therapy:**\n    *   *Individual Therapy:* Can help individuals understand their illness, manage symptoms, and develop coping strategies.\n    *   *Group Therapy:* Provides a supportive environment to connect with others who understand what they're going through.\n    *   *Family Therapy:* Helps families understand schizophrenia and learn how to support their loved one.\n*   **Rehabilitation:**\n    *   *Social Skills Training:* Helps individuals improve their communication and social interaction skills.\n    *   *Vocational Rehabilitation:* Provides support and training to help individuals find and maintain employment.\n*   **Hospitalization:** Hospitalization may be necessary during acute episodes of psychosis or when a person is a danger to themselves or others.\n\n**3. Supporting Someone with Schizophrenia**\n\n*   **Communication Tips:**\n    *   *Empathy:* Try to understand the person's perspective, even if you don't agree with their beliefs.\n    *   *Active Listening:* Pay attention to what the person is saying and ask clarifying questions.\n    *   *Avoid Arguing:* Arguing with someone about their delusions is unlikely to be helpful. Instead, focus on their feelings and offer support.\n*   **Managing Symptoms and Relapses:**\n    *   *Medication Adherence:* Encourage the person to take their medication as prescribed.\n    *   *Early Intervention:* Be aware of the early warning signs of relapse (e.g., increased anxiety, sleep disturbances) and seek professional help promptly.\n    *   *Stress Management:* Help the person identify and manage stressors in their life.\n*   **Creating a Supportive Environment:**\n    *   *Reduce Stimulation:* Create a calm and quiet environment to minimize sensory overload.\n    *   *Establish Routine:* Help the person establish a regular daily routine to provide structure and stability.\n    *   *Promote Healthy Habits:* Encourage healthy eating, regular exercise, and adequate sleep.\n*   **Addressing Stigma:** Challenge negative stereotypes about schizophrenia and advocate for understanding and acceptance.\n\n**4. Vegetarian Considerations**\n\nFor individuals with schizophrenia who follow a vegetarian diet, it's essential to ensure they are meeting their nutritional needs.\n\n*   **Nutritional Needs:** Vegetarians need to pay attention to getting enough protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n*   **Potential Benefits:** Some studies suggest that a vegetarian diet may have mental health benefits, potentially due to the high intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n*   **Meal Planning Tips:**\n    *   *Focus on Whole Foods:* Choose whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.\n    *   *Include Protein Sources:* Incorporate protein-rich vegetarian foods like beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, and seeds.\n    *   *Consider Supplementation:* Talk to a doctor or registered dietitian about whether supplementation is necessary, especially for vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n**5. Resources and Support**\n\n*   **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/)\n*   **MentalHealth.gov:** [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/)\n*   **Local Mental Health Services:** Search online for mental health services in your area.\n*   **Support Groups:** NAMI and other organizations offer support groups for individuals with schizophrenia and their families.\n\n**A Note for Computer Science Professionals:**\n\nJust as debugging code requires a systematic approach, managing schizophrenia involves a step-by-step process of understanding the condition, implementing treatment strategies, and providing ongoing support. Technology can also play a role in improving access to care and promoting self-management.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This guide is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.
