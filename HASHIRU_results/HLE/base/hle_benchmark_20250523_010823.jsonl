I need to identify two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, given that the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, and ignoring Gettier problems.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.  **Research JTB Definition:** I'll start by using the search tool to get a clear and concise explanation of the JTB definition of knowledge.\n2.  **Identify Core Components:** I'll break down the JTB definition into its core components: justification, truth, and belief.\n3.  **Analyze Problems (Excluding Gettier):** I'll analyze potential problems that arise when considering only Knowledge and Belief as epistemic states. I'll focus on issues *other* than Gettier problems. This will likely involve thinking about the relationship between justification, truth, and belief in this limited framework.\n4.  **Formulate Answer:** I'll synthesize my findings into a clear and concise answer, highlighting two specific problems.\n\nHere's the first step, researching the JTB definition:\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'query': 'Justified True Belief definition of knowledge'}, name='GoogleSearchTool'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"message\": \"Tool `GoogleSearchTool` failed to run.\",\n  \"output\": \"Tool invocation mode is disabled\"\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `GoogleSearchTool` with \n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"Justified True Belief definition of knowledge\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='GoogleSearchTool', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `GoogleSearchTool` failed to run.', 'output': 'Tool invocation mode is disabled'}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, the Google Search Tool failed.

They must be **justified** in believing it.\n\nNow, considering the constraint that our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, let's analyze the potential problems with JTB (excluding Gettier problems).\n\nHere are two problems that arise:\n\n1.  **Circularity of Justification:** If our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, then justification itself must be either knowledge or belief. If justification is *belief*, then the JTB definition becomes \"True Belief Believed,\" which is clearly insufficient for knowledge. If justification is *knowledge*, then the JTB definition becomes \"Knowledge True Belief,\" which is circular. Knowledge is defined in terms of knowledge, making the definition uninformative.\n\n2.  **The Nature of Belief:** The JTB definition assumes a clear distinction between belief and knowledge. However, if those are our *only* epistemic states, it becomes difficult to differentiate between a justified *belief* that happens to be true and *knowledge*. What separates a justified true belief from knowledge if knowledge is *also* a justified true belief? The JTB definition doesn't provide a clear mechanism for distinguishing between the two states when they are the only options. It essentially collapses knowledge into a specific type of belief (justified and true), without explaining what makes it a distinct epistemic state.\n\nTherefore, the two problems are the circularity of justification and the lack of a clear distinction between knowledge and justified true belief when those are the only available epistemic states.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 1. Circularity of Justification: If justification is belief, JTB is insufficient. If justification is knowledge, JTB is circular. 2.
