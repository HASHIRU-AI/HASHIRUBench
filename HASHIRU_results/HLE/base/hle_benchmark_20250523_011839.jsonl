I'll be looking for things like chiasmus, anaphora, ellipsis, hendiadys, etc.\n2.  **Research potential devices:** If I identify a possible device, I'll use online resources to confirm its definition and usage in Latin poetry.\n3.  **Confirm presence in the line:** I'll make sure the device is genuinely present and contributes to the line's effect.\n4.  **Formulate the final answer.**\n\nLet's start by analyzing the line:\n\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n\n*   **Word order:** The word order seems significant. \"Lucifer, almum\" are separated, which could be a form of hyperbaton (already excluded). The placement of \"veniens\" might also be relevant.\n*   **Repetition:** There isn't obvious repetition of words or sounds (beyond the excluded alliteration/assonance).\n*   **Meaning:** The line is a call to Lucifer (the morning star) to be born and bring the nourishing day.\n\nA possible device is **tmesis**. Tmesis is the separation of parts of a compound word by the intervention of one or more other words.\n\nLet's research tmesis and its use in Latin poetry.
