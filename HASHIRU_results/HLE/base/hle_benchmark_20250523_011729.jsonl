Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    *   We're given a primitive recursive programming language P.\n    *   K(n) is the Kolmogorov complexity of n, defined as the length of the shortest program in P that outputs n.\n    *   The question is whether there exists an algorithm to compute K(n) for any given n.\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis:**\n    *   It's highly likely that K(n) is *not* computable. This is a well-known result in computability theory. The intuition is that to compute K(n), you'd need to search through all possible programs of increasing length and check if they output n. However, determining whether a program halts and outputs a specific value is undecidable (the halting problem).\n\n3.  **Research and Proof Strategy:**\n    *   We'll use the `GoogleSearchTool` to search for \"Kolmogorov complexity computability\" and related terms to find a formal proof or a strong argument against computability.\n    *   If we find a proof sketch, we'll try to elaborate on it.\n\n4.  **Tool Invocation and Analysis:**\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'query': 'Kolmogorov complexity computability undecidable'}, name='GoogleSearchTool'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"message\": \"Tool `GoogleSearchTool` failed to run.\",\n  \"output\": \"Tool invocation mode is disabled\"\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `GoogleSearchTool` with \n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"Kolmogorov complexity computability undecidable\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='GoogleSearchTool', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `GoogleSearchTool` failed to run.', 'output': 'Tool invocation mode is disabled'}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since tool invocation is disabled, I will proceed with my existing knowledge.\n\n5.  **Proof Sketch (Based on Existing Knowledge):**\n\n    *   Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that K(n) is computable.
