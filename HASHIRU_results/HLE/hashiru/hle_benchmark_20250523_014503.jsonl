They mostly discuss Reservoir Computing (RC) in wireless communication.\n\nSince general searches are failing, I will try to find the answer by reasoning about the circuit. A ladder network is a cascade of identical RC sections. For a single RC low-pass filter, the cutoff frequency is given by $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC}$. As we add more stages to the ladder network, the cutoff frequency will change. However, without knowing the exact configuration of the ladder network (number of stages, series or parallel R and C), it's difficult to give a precise answer.\n\nHowever, I can make an educated guess. For a simple RC ladder network, the cutoff frequency will be of the form $\\frac{k}{RC}$, where $k$ is a constant that depends on the number of stages and the specific configuration.

They mostly discuss Reservoir Computing (RC) in wireless communication.\n\nSince general searches are failing, I will try to find the answer by reasoning about the circuit. A ladder network is a cascade of identical RC sections. For a single RC low-pass filter, the cutoff frequency is given by $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC}$. As we add more stages to the ladder network, the cutoff frequency will change.
