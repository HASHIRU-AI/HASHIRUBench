(McShane Decl., \u00b6 5). \nUpon being publicly listed, the stock pri ce of Dakota Plains almost immediately \nrose to $12 per share on very light volume and stayed at or near $12 per share for almost \nexactly 20 days.  The price then declined gra dually until September 24, 2012.  Since \nSeptember 24, 2012, Dakota Plains has neve r traded above $4.24, and it is currently \ntrading under $1.  As a result of the stock price during the initial 20-day period, Dakota \nPlains disclosed that the noteholders were en titled to receive payments of approximately \n$32.9 million.

Jessica Gilbertson\u2019s Relevance to the Investigation  \nBased upon the SEC\u2019s investigation to date, it appears that Jessica Gilbertson was \ninvolved in a number of transact ions in Dakota Plains stock or promissory notes that may \nhave been made by or at the direction of her former husband , Ryan Gilbertson.  Although \nRyan Gilbertson had no publicly disclosed ro le with Dakota Plains, he had substantial \ninvolvement with the company.  Among othe r things, Ryan Gilbertson, a foundation \ncontrolled by him, and Ryan and Jessica\u2019s mi nor child collectively held approximately \n$3.5 million of the promissory  notes containing the additi onal payment provisions.  \n(McShane Decl., \u00b6 7). \nThe SEC ob", "gold_answer": "Craig M McKenzie,Timothy R Brady,Gabriel G Claypool,Ryan Gilbertson,Michael L Reger", "model_response": "The provided text is an excerpt from a legal document related to an SEC investigation into Dakota Plains.

Would that change Rumsfeld?", "context": "", "gold_answer": "Clarification", "model_response": "This question touches on the Solomon Amendment and its implications for law schools' relationship with military recruiters. The core issue is whether requiring law schools to actively *promote* military careers, rather than simply allowing access for recruitment, would alter the legal landscape established by *Rumsfeld v. FAIR*.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Current Law (Rumsfeld v. FAIR):** The Supreme Court held that the Solomon Amendment, which withholds federal funding from universities that deny military recruiters equal access to campus, is constitutional. The Court reasoned that the law schools were not being compelled to *endorse* the military's message, only to provide access. This was deemed an acceptable condition on federal funding.\n*   **The Proposed Change:** The question posits a scenario where law schools are *required* to actively collaborate with the military to create promotional materials and statements *endorsing* military careers. This goes beyond mere access.\n*   **Potential Impact:** This proposed change could significantly alter the legal analysis. Arguments against the requirement could include:\n    *   **Compelled Speech:** Requiring law schools to create and disseminate pro-military statements could be viewed as compelled speech, violating the First Amendment. *Rumsfeld v. FAIR* hinged on the distinction between access and endorsement.\n    *   **Academic Freedom:** Such a requirement could infringe upon the academic freedom of law schools to present diverse viewpoints and counsel students on a range of career options.\n    *   **Unconstitutional Conditions:** Even with federal funding at stake, the government cannot impose conditions that violate constitutional rights. The compelled speech argument could be framed as an unconstitutional condition.\n*   **Likelihood of Changing the Outcome:** It is highly likely that this change would lead to a different legal outcome than *Rumsfeld v. FAIR*. The compelled speech and academic freedom arguments would be much stronger, and a court might well find the requirement unconstitutional.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Yes, requiring law schools to actively collaborate with the military to create promotional materials and statements endorsing military careers would likely change the outcome of a legal challenge compared to Rumsfeld v. FAIR. The compelled speech and academic freedom arguments would be significantly stronger, potentially leading a court to find the requirement unconstitutional.\n", "normalized_prediction": "Yes, requiring law schools to actively collaborate with the military to create promotional materials and statements endorsing military careers would likely change the outcome of a legal challenge compared to Rumsfeld v.

My ex was a controlling abuser. Emotionally physically and now sexually she abused me. I was young dumb and in love. When we broke up she was flirting with my step brother heavily, this angered me and I had screen shots of the messaged (she left her insta logged in my phone) and I threatened to show her parents what kinda person she is. She then got a RO against me for the reason of me telling her parents. She lied in the entire thing. Making up abuse and criminal charges against me. i.e. She said I was charged with assault 2 never happened. She said I am a felon( I was a felon about a year ago got in reduced per plea deal, the felony was for selling 2 grams of weed to a friend when I was 18. I live in Oregon too, fuck me right?) anyways the order got granted I tried to fight it, i fucked up and missed court. So I am Unable to fight it.   Before she got the order she mentioned she was going to, so I start to compile evidence, I have so much on her. She would blackmail me with self harm daily, I have a picture where she carved my name into her leg with a knife. I mean it she messed me up with all these games. I find in my google drive a video taken from my phone by her, of her touching me and riding me from a POV style. I am dead asleep obviously in the video. This is rape. This is sexual assault. This isn't the first time She would do this. We would fight and she would try and force sex on to me to make me feel better. I would literally have to fight her off. Cuz I obv didn't want it.   I realize I want to wait till after the restraining order blows over to report the crime. Since it is over due to my incompetence, i feel as if it's a good time to report. I report earlier today to the local PD. No lawyer. No counsel. Just you guys. He says he is going to investigate her for invasion of privacy. I think to my self that this is just the start, and when detectives see the video, they will drop the hammer. The policeman doesn't even wanna see it. He just takes my word and calls her. After his talk with her he's dismissing the case. I swear he probably told her what to say. She even admitted in the video it's her. And when I found the video initially before the RO was served I confronted her about it. I asked why did she have sex with me with no consent you know that's rape right? Or something along the lines. She said I woke up during the video. So it was fine. Which is a lie. The officer told me she said we filmed many of our sexual encounters (not many but some) and we would wake up daily at 2 am to have sex. (Another lie) I was bringing all the money in I needed my sleep.   Another bone in this is that someone is messaging her off a private instagram, telling her that I'm Spreading nude photos of her. (Complete lie and not me doing this I'm not gonna risk violating my RO) I feel it's another ex BF one whom she claimed raped her (she lied about it she went to his house and fucked him a week later while dating me :( ) and he's kinda getting some revenge on her for this. I'm very scared I'm gonna get framed for something I didn't do, I swear the cop was more concerned about this instagram ghost then he was about me. He didn't care to watch my clips, and he hung up on me mid sentence.   I'm shocked everyone. I'm in awe. I have to take Xanax (prescribed) to just sleep. The betrayal is more then I can handle. I'm calling a lawyer Monday morning and seeing what he says. In the meantime any idea from you all? I called just the local PD but I feel the sheriffs will take this much more seriously.

From what I remember he said he would leave the case open, and have a detective check it out. Thank god. My light isn't done yet. I wanna get a lawyer asap I am Just low in cash. And since I know I'm not Messaging her, spreading her nudes, or getting anyone else to messaged her, I won't be in trouble I hope. But you never know.   She also says she has some voice recordings from When I found out she was flirting hard with my step bro. I was furious. All I said was that I was gonna ruin her life by telling her parents yadadada I was really angry. Never made threats of violence at all or anything really illegal. Just a little annoyance.

Next we tried to file a claim with our insurance (under the liability clause), but it was denied because the insurance company stated that I'm not liable, since the damage was not caused by my negligence.

Alice takes the standard deduction. <br> How much tax does Alice have to pay in 2017?", "gold_answer": "$2684", "model_response": "First, we need to determine Alice's filing status. The problem states that Alice's gross income is $22895 and she takes the standard deduction. Since the problem doesn't specify her marital status, whether she is a head of household or a surviving spouse, we will assume she is an unmarried individual.\n\nNext, we need to calculate Alice's taxable income. Taxable income is gross income minus deductions. Since Alice takes the standard deduction, we need to determine the standard deduction amount for an unmarried individual in 2017. According to \u00a763(c)(2)(C), the basic standard deduction is $3,000. However, \u00a763(c)(7) states that for taxable years 2018 through 2025, this amount is $12,000. Since the year is 2017, the basic standard deduction is $3,000.\n\nTherefore, Alice's taxable income is $22895 - $3000 = $19895.\n\nNow we need to determine the tax rate based on Alice's taxable income and filing status. Since Alice is an unmarried individual with a taxable income of $19895, we refer to \u00a71(c).\n\n(i) 15% of taxable income if the taxable income is not over $22,100.\n\nSince $19895 is not over $22,100, Alice's tax is 15% of $19895.\n\nCalculating the tax: $19895 * 0.15 = $2984.25\n\nFINAL ANSWER: $2984.25\n", "normalized_prediction": "$2984.25", "correct": false, "response_time": 3.5963618755340576}

We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. APO(a)-L Rx , AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx , AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx and AKCEA-TTR-L Rx , are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform. Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which enhances the effective uptake and activity of these drugs in particular tissues.  TEGSEDI is the world's first subcutaneous, RNA-targeted therapeutic that substantially reduces the production of transthyretin, or TTR protein. Importantly, TEGSEDI is Akcea's first commercially approved drug, and our launch is underway in three regions: the U.S., the E.U. and Canada. We are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved in the future as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. For example, at approval we launched Akcea Connect TM , a drug treatment program made up of dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience, in the United States. This program offers free, private and personalized support to patients and their caregivers and families across the country. Internationally, Akcea Connect is being rolled out in each of the countries where we launch with what we believe is the highest level of patient and physician support allowed in accordance with local regulations. Accredo to be our specialty pharmacy partner for the distribution of TEGSEDI in the U.S. We chose Express Scripts' Accredo Health Group, Inc., or Accredo because of their experience supporting the unique needs of rare disease communities and their proven track record for simplifying access to therapy. Accredo has a team of specialty clinicians, pharmacists and over 600 field-based nurses located throughout the U.S. who are augmenting the Akcea Connect team of nurse case managers to provide support and address the needs of the hATTR amyloidosis community. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass\\u2122 in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis.\", \"company_name\": \"Akcea Therapeutics, Inc.\", \"index\": \"327\"}", "context": "", "gold_answer": "Yes", "model_response": "FINAL ANSWER: Yes\n", "normalized_prediction": "Yes", "correct": true, "response_time": 0.9995348453521729}

{"task": "learned_hands_housing", "question": "After a traumatizing roommate experience, and a long search for affordable housing, I signed a lease of one year on a lockout type apartment underneath someone's vacation home. (I'm on the coast of North Carolina). They are a conservative, religious elderly couple who go to bed at 8 pm. I knew from the start we would have some personality clashes, and I only took the place because I was desperate and I was under the impression they would not be there full time.    They were hesitant to rent to me because I'm a bartender; I work long hours and come home late. Additionally, I am severely mentally ill and I have a cat, who is an emotional support animal which I have the necessary documents for, signed by my psychiatrist. I am well aware that private renters don't have to accommodate non-life saving assistance animals, and I signed the lease just so happy someone would rent to me. They added to the lease that they could kick me out at any time with 30 days notice if they decided my cat was \"a nuisance\". This, coupled with the fact that the man had the audacity to ask me WHY I have PTSD, were red flags, but for lack of other options, I signed anyway.   Well this past week, I've been dealing with the death of a friend and co-worker who was shot and killed last Saturday. Cleaning has been on the back burner, and I've had trouble keeping a clean living space my whole life anyway, as a result of my depression. I know it's not a good excuse but it is what it is. This is not to say I live in filth; my clothes are all over the floor and sometimes there's a few empty pizza boxes lying around, but the litter box is scooped twice a week and dumped/replaced every 2 weeks.   Well, literally as I'm walking up to my door coming home from the funeral, my landlord informs me that it's not working out, claiming that he can smell the litter box from upstairs. Funny, since I dumped and changed out the litter that morning. Furthermore, if it had been an issue, I would think most reasonable adults would want to have a conversation before evicting someone with very few options from their home. I asked if the deposit I paid upon moving in, equal to the amount of my rent, would cover the 30 days. He said no, reread the lease, it's a security deposit and not the last months rent. Well since he waited until the 27th of the month to inform me that I needed to move out, and I obviously can't afford to pay for another month if I have to find a new place, I have 3 days to get out. That's not really a problem, I can stay with my boyfriend and I don't want to live under these people anymore anyway. Additionally, I went back last night to retrieve my birth control pills I had forgotten there before I moved my things out today. When I first left the apartment I know for a FACT I locked the doorknob and not the deadbolt. When I returned to get the medication, the deadbolt was locked. Indicating that my landlord had been in without permission or notification and I have no way of knowing he didn't dig through my stuff. I'm very upset about this, and how poorly he has handled all of it. I understand completely that the whole house is his property, but how is it legal that he entered my apartment, which is still leased to me until the 31st, without at least notifying me?  Most of all, I'm concerned about getting my deposit back. In my lease, it is stated that the deposit is to be returned to me minus any costs for damages. The only damage to the entire place is one small lipstick stain on the bathroom wall, maybe half the size of a dime. I've removed my things, cleaned top to bottom, and everything looks as it did when I signed the lease. There is absolutely no way he should get to keep my entire $500 deposit over a tiny lipstick stain. If he tries to do this, is there anything I can do? They aren't customers at my restaurant, we have no mutual friends, and I have no personal ties to them whatsoever. I have no qualms about taking him to court if that's what it comes to.
