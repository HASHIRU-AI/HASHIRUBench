{"task": "oral_argument_question_purpose", "question": "What if the law schools also had to make available their CDO to sit down with the military and help them craft, you know, in a statement that would be attributable to the military, you know, this is why a career with the military -- this is what it would be, this is why it's attractive, and then post it? Would that change Rumsfeld?", "context": "", "gold_answer": "Clarification", "model_response": "This hypothetical scenario suggests a potential solution to the issues raised in *Rumsfeld v. FAIR*. The core of the *Rumsfeld* case was the Solomon Amendment, which threatened to withhold federal funding from law schools that restricted military recruiters' access to their campuses. Law schools often objected to the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, arguing it discriminated against LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nThe proposed solution involves law school Career Development Offices (CDOs) actively collaborating with the military to create recruitment materials. These materials would explicitly outline the benefits and attractions of a military career, directly addressing potential concerns and promoting inclusivity (or at least attempting to). The materials would be attributable to the military, not the law school, maintaining the school's institutional stance while still complying with the Solomon Amendment.\n\nWhether this would \"change Rumsfeld\" (i.e., alter the Supreme Court's ruling or the underlying conflict) is debatable. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Potential Benefits:**\n\n    *   **Compliance:** It could satisfy the Solomon Amendment's requirement for equal access, as the military would have a platform to present its case.\n    *   **Transparency:** Openly addressing concerns about military policy might attract a broader range of students, including those who were previously hesitant.\n    *   **Dialogue:** It fosters communication between law schools and the military, potentially leading to a better understanding of each other's perspectives.\n*   **Potential Drawbacks:**\n\n    *   **Endorsement Concerns:** Law schools might still be perceived as endorsing military policies, even if the materials are attributed to the military. This could alienate students and faculty who strongly oppose those policies.\n    *   **Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of the recruitment materials would depend on their content and how well they address student concerns. A superficial or disingenuous approach could backfire.\n    *   **Free Speech Issues:** Some might argue that requiring CDOs to actively participate in creating recruitment materials infringes on their freedom of speech.\n    *   **Practicality:** The level of cooperation required from both law schools and the military might be difficult to achieve in practice. Some law schools might refuse to participate, and the military might be unwilling to compromise on its policies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile this approach might offer a compromise, it's unlikely to fundamentally \"change Rumsfeld.\" The Supreme Court's decision in *Rumsfeld v. FAIR* was based on the principle that Congress has the power to require law schools to provide military recruiters with the same access as other employers. This solution doesn't challenge that principle. It merely attempts to mitigate the concerns that led to the conflict in the first place. The underlying tension between non-discrimination policies and military regulations would likely persist, even with this collaborative approach.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: It's unlikely to fundamentally change the legal outcome of *Rumsfeld v. FAIR*, but it could potentially mitigate the underlying conflict by fostering dialogue and transparency, although concerns about endorsement and free speech might remain.", "normalized_prediction": "It's unlikely to fundamentally change the legal outcome of *Rumsfeld v.

This is a long read but quite interesting. Anyone who can help you may be saving a life. I have no where else to turn and I am miserable ridden with pain and anxiety. Here we go.  My ex was a controlling abuser. Emotionally physically and now sexually she abused me. I was young dumb and in love. When we broke up she was flirting with my step brother heavily, this angered me and I had screen shots of the messaged (she left her insta logged in my phone) and I threatened to show her parents what kinda person she is. She then got a RO against me for the reason of me telling her parents. She lied in the entire thing. Making up abuse and criminal charges against me. i.e. She said I was charged with assault 2 never happened. She said I am a felon( I was a felon about a year ago got in reduced per plea deal, the felony was for selling 2 grams of weed to a friend when I was 18. I live in Oregon too, fuck me right?) anyways the order got granted I tried to fight it, i fucked up and missed court. So I am Unable to fight it.   Before she got the order she mentioned she was going to, so I start to compile evidence, I have so much on her. She would blackmail me with self harm daily, I have a picture where she carved my name into her leg with a knife. I mean it she messed me up with all these games. I find in my google drive a video taken from my phone by her, of her touching me and riding me from a POV style. I am dead asleep obviously in the video. This is rape. This is sexual assault. This isn't the first time She would do this. We would fight and she would try and force sex on to me to make me feel better. I would literally have to fight her off. Cuz I obv didn't want it.   I realize I want to wait till after the restraining order blows over to report the crime. Since it is over due to my incompetence, i feel as if it's a good time to report. I report earlier today to the local PD. No lawyer. No counsel. Just you guys. He says he is going to investigate her for invasion of privacy. I think to my self that this is just the start, and when detectives see the video, they will drop the hammer. The policeman doesn't even wanna see it. He just takes my word and calls her. After his talk with her he's dismissing the case. I swear he probably told her what to say. She even admitted in the video it's her. And when I found the video initially before the RO was served I confronted her about it. I asked why did she have sex with me with no consent you know that's rape right? Or something along the lines. She said I woke up during the video. So it was fine. Which is a lie. The officer told me she said we filmed many of our sexual encounters (not many but some) and we would wake up daily at 2 am to have sex. (Another lie) I was bringing all the money in I needed my sleep.   Another bone in this is that someone is messaging her off a private instagram, telling her that I'm Spreading nude photos of her. (Complete lie and not me doing this I'm not gonna risk violating my RO) I feel it's another ex BF one whom she claimed raped her (she lied about it she went to his house and fucked him a week later while dating me :( ) and he's kinda getting some revenge on her for this. I'm very scared I'm gonna get framed for something I didn't do, I swear the cop was more concerned about this instagram ghost then he was about me. He didn't care to watch my clips, and he hung up on me mid sentence.   I'm shocked everyone. I'm in awe. I have to take Xanax (prescribed) to just sleep. The betrayal is more then I can handle. I'm calling a lawyer Monday morning and seeing what he says. In the meantime any idea from you all? I called just the local PD but I feel the sheriffs will take this much more seriously. After pleading with the officer that I'm a victim and this is rape since it's sex with no consent. He said I shoulda woke up and wasn't on anything. He was just bullshitting me the whole time. From what I remember he said he would leave the case open, and have a detective check it out. Thank god. My light isn't done yet. I wanna get a lawyer asap I am Just low in cash. And since I know I'm not Messaging her, spreading her nudes, or getting anyone else to messaged her, I won't be in trouble I hope. But you never know.   She also says she has some voice recordings from When I found out she was flirting hard with my step bro. I was furious. All I said was that I was gonna ruin her life by telling her parents yadadada I was really angry. Never made threats of violence at all or anything really illegal. Just a little annoyance.   So guys what do I do? Be worried about this instagram ghost? Get a good lawyer? Or get legal aid? Very confused ,scared and alone. The cop treated me like a fucking joke. If the genders were reversed here I'd be rotting in jail as I type this. Any and all comments welcome. I love you all truly. This is a very hard time in my life, and if I don't find the strength I will fall.   PS: if I post something about her, not sexual or anything, on my fb, is that gonna get me in trouble?

Alice was a nonresident alien until July 9th, 2014. Bob died September 16th, 2017. Alice's gross income in 2013 was $71414. Bob's gross income in 2013 was $56404. Alice files separately and takes the standard deduction. <br> How much tax does Alice have to pay in 2013?", "gold_answer": "$17783", "model_response": "Let's break down Alice's tax situation for 2013.\n\n1.  **Marital Status:** In 2013, Alice and Bob were married. However, Alice files separately.\n\n2.  **Nonresident Alien Status:** Alice was a nonresident alien for part of 2013. The law states \"no joint return shall be made if either the husband or wife at any time during the taxable year is a nonresident alien.\" However, this only applies to joint returns. Since Alice is filing separately, her nonresident alien status affects her own filing.\n\n3.  **Standard Deduction:** Alice takes the standard deduction. However, \u00a763(c)(6)(B) states that a nonresident alien individual is not eligible for the standard deduction. Therefore, her standard deduction is zero.\n\n4.  **Personal Exemption:** Alice can claim a personal exemption under \u00a7151(b) unless she is the dependent of another taxpayer. There's no indication she is, so she can claim the exemption amount. In 2013, the exemption amount under \u00a7151(d)(1) is $2,000.\n\n5.  **Taxable Income:** Taxable income is gross income minus deductions. Alice's gross income is $71,414. Her deductions are the personal exemption of $2,000. Therefore, her taxable income is $71,414 - $2,000 = $69,414.\n\n6.  **Tax Calculation:** Since Alice is married filing separately, we use \u00a71(d) to calculate her tax.\n\n    *   (i) 15% of taxable income if the taxable income is not over $18,450;\n    *   (ii) $2,767.50, plus 28% of the excess over $18,450 if the taxable income is over $18,450 but not over $44,575;\n    *   (iii) $10,082.50, plus 31% of the excess over $44,575 if the taxable income is over $44,575 but not over $70,000;\n\n    Alice's taxable income of $69,414 falls into the third bracket.\n\n    *   Tax = $10,082.50 + 0.31 * ($69,414 - $44,575)\n    *   Tax = $10,082.50 + 0.31 * ($24,839)\n    *   Tax = $10,082.50 + $7,699.09\n    *   Tax = $17,781.59\n\nFINAL ANSWER: $17,781.59", "normalized_prediction": "$17,781.59", "correct": false, "response_time": 4.7254579067230225}

Alice takes the standard deduction. <br> How much tax does Alice have to pay in 2017?", "gold_answer": "$2684", "model_response": "To determine Alice's tax liability, we need to figure out her filing status and taxable income. The problem states Alice takes the standard deduction. Since no marital status is given, we will assume she is an unmarried individual (other than a surviving spouse and head of household).\n\n1.  **Standard Deduction:** According to \u00a763(c)(2)(C), the basic standard deduction for an unmarried individual in 2017 is $3,000.\n\n2.  **Taxable Income:** Taxable income is gross income minus the standard deduction and personal exemptions (\u00a763(b)). Alice's gross income is $22,895.  The standard deduction is $3,000.  She is entitled to one personal exemption of $2,000 under \u00a7151(b). Therefore, her taxable income is $22,895 - $3,000 - $2,000 = $17,895.\n\n3.  **Tax Calculation:**  Since Alice is an unmarried individual, we use \u00a71(c) to calculate her tax. Her taxable income of $17,895 falls under the first bracket: 15% of taxable income if the taxable income is not over $22,100.\n\n    Therefore, her tax is 15% of $17,895, which is 0.15 * $17,895 = $2,684.25.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: $2,684.25", "normalized_prediction": "$2,684.25", "correct": false, "response_time": 2.8927669525146484}

We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. APO(a)-L Rx , AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx , AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx and AKCEA-TTR-L Rx , are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform. Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which enhances the effective uptake and activity of these drugs in particular tissues.  TEGSEDI is the world's first subcutaneous, RNA-targeted therapeutic that substantially reduces the production of transthyretin, or TTR protein. Importantly, TEGSEDI is Akcea's first commercially approved drug, and our launch is underway in three regions: the U.S., the E.U. and Canada. We are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved in the future as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. For example, at approval we launched Akcea Connect TM , a drug treatment program made up of dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience, in the United States. This program offers free, private and personalized support to patients and their caregivers and families across the country.

I knew from the start we would have some personality clashes, and I only took the place because I was desperate and I was under the impression they would not be there full time.    They were hesitant to rent to me because I'm a bartender; I work long hours and come home late. Additionally, I am severely mentally ill and I have a cat, who is an emotional support animal which I have the necessary documents for, signed by my psychiatrist. I am well aware that private renters don't have to accommodate non-life saving assistance animals, and I signed the lease just so happy someone would rent to me. They added to the lease that they could kick me out at any time with 30 days notice if they decided my cat was \"a nuisance\". This, coupled with the fact that the man had the audacity to ask me WHY I have PTSD, were red flags, but for lack of other options, I signed anyway.   Well this past week, I've been dealing with the death of a friend and co-worker who was shot and killed last Saturday. Cleaning has been on the back burner, and I've had trouble keeping a clean living space my whole life anyway, as a result of my depression. I know it's not a good excuse but it is what it is. This is not to say I live in filth; my clothes are all over the floor and sometimes there's a few empty pizza boxes lying around, but the litter box is scooped twice a week and dumped/replaced every 2 weeks.   Well, literally as I'm walking up to my door coming home from the funeral, my landlord informs me that it's not working out, claiming that he can smell the litter box from upstairs. Funny, since I dumped and changed out the litter that morning. Furthermore, if it had been an issue, I would think most reasonable adults would want to have a conversation before evicting someone with very few options from their home. I asked if the deposit I paid upon moving in, equal to the amount of my rent, would cover the 30 days. He said no, reread the lease, it's a security deposit and not the last months rent. Well since he waited until the 27th of the month to inform me that I needed to move out, and I obviously can't afford to pay for another month if I have to find a new place, I have 3 days to get out. That's not really a problem, I can stay with my boyfriend and I don't want to live under these people anymore anyway. Additionally, I went back last night to retrieve my birth control pills I had forgotten there before I moved my things out today. When I first left the apartment I know for a FACT I locked the doorknob and not the deadbolt. When I returned to get the medication, the deadbolt was locked. Indicating that my landlord had been in without permission or notification and I have no way of knowing he didn't dig through my stuff. I'm very upset about this, and how poorly he has handled all of it. I understand completely that the whole house is his property, but how is it legal that he entered my apartment, which is still leased to me until the 31st, without at least notifying me?  Most of all, I'm concerned about getting my deposit back. In my lease, it is stated that the deposit is to be returned to me minus any costs for damages. The only damage to the entire place is one small lipstick stain on the bathroom wall, maybe half the size of a dime. I've removed my things, cleaned top to bottom, and everything looks as it did when I signed the lease.

{"task": "supply_chain_disclosure_disclosed_training", "question": "Policy Against Slavery and Human Trafficking\n\nYokohama Tire Corporation (\"Yokohama\") is committed to a work environment free from human trafficking and slavery. We oppose any use of slavery or human trafficking in the manufacture and distribution of our products and fully support the promotion of ethical and lawful employment practices within our workplace. Accordingly, Yokohama employees and suppliers are expected to abide by these same principles. All Yokohama management and staff are responsible for following these policies. Over time, Yokohama will continue to develop and clarify these policies and supplementary procedures. Willful noncompliance with these policies and procedures may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\nWhat is Human Trafficking? What is Slavery?\n\nAccording to the United Nations, \"human trafficking\" is \"the process by which a person is recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, or received through a use of force, coercion, or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them.\" The United Nations also defines \"slavery\" as \"the status or condition of a person over whom any or all the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised,\" or \"the status or condition of a person over whom control is exercised to the extent that the person is treated like property.\" This policy also covers forced labor (all work or service, not voluntarily performed, that is obtained from an individual under threat of force or penalty) and harmful child labor (the employment of children that is economically exploitative, or is likely to be hazardous to, or interfere with, the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health, or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development).\n\nPolicy Against Slavery and Human Trafficking\n\nYokohama is developing policies and procedures that support the disclosure requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1714.43. Such policies and procedures may include:\n\nPublic disclosures of our policy against slavery and human trafficking, along with our activities implementing the same, on Yokohama's website;\n\nProcedures outlining what is expected from management, employees, and suppliers to better identify, prevent and mitigate the use of forced labor in our supply chain, including, but not limited to maintaining open lines of communication between these parties;\n\nA plan to initiate training for company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management focusing, among other things, on monitoring and mitigating risks related to the presence of slavery and human trafficking within the product supply chain;\n\nand Supporting compliance by suppliers with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which those suppliers operate with respect to the products or materials they supply. Such compliance includes:\n\nNot using forced or compulsory labor;\n\nEnsuring that overall terms of employment are voluntary;\n\nComplying with minimum age requirements prescribed by applicable laws or contracts;\n\nCompensating workers with wages and benefits that meet or exceed legally required minimums and overtime pay requirements;\n\nand Abiding by applicable law concerning the maximum hours of daily labor.\n\nYokohama may also require suppliers to certify to its compliance with the above requirements.\n\nYokohama will not continue to purchase goods or services from any supplier of which it is made aware to be engaging in human trafficking or using slave labor without proper cure or remedy of such practices. Yokohama is permitted to audit its suppliers' compliance with these policies. If the supplier is presenting a serious risk, the audit may be unannounced. Although Yokohama regularly monitors its suppliers for a variety of reasons, an audit is typically not performed to determine compliance with the prohibitions against slavery and human trafficking, nor are these audits typically conducted by third parties. Nevertheless, Yokohama will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim or indication that a supplier is engaging in human trafficking or slave labor.\n\nProcedures\n\nYokohama Tire Company fully supports the purpose and goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and opposes any use of slavery or human trafficking in the manufacture and distribution of our products. We have adopted an initial company policy condemning the use of slavery and human trafficking. We are continuing to develop this policy to include processes that will help identify, prevent and mitigate the impact of forced labor in our supply chain and that will hold our employees and suppliers appropriately accountable for the policy's implementation. Moreover,\n\nWe maintain open lines of communication with our suppliers, managers, employees, investors, customers, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe are evaluating our supplier agreements as well as the terms and conditions found in our standard purchase agreements to determine ways to ensure our suppliers are complying with our policy against slavery and human trafficking. Although neither we nor a third party currently evaluate our supply chains for risks associated with these practices, we are exploring the possibility of requiring direct suppliers to be responsible for monitoring the compliance of their own suppliers with our policy.\n\nWe are also considering how to properly provide training on our policy to our employees and managers on our policy and processes.\n\nAlthough we do not currently conduct audits of our suppliers, we are considering the role of internal audits and self-reporting by suppliers as a method of compliance. Independent auditors or unannounced audits are not currently employed but will be considered if the circumstances require.", "context": "Policy Against Slavery and Human Trafficking\n\nYokohama Tire Corporation (\"Yokohama\") is committed to a work environment free from human trafficking and slavery.

What is Slavery?\n\nAccording to the United Nations, \"human trafficking\" is \"the process by which a person is recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, or received through a use of force, coercion, or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them.\" The United Nations also defines \"slavery\" as \"the status or condition of a person over whom any or all the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised,\" or \"the status or condition of a person over whom control is exercised to the extent that the person is treated like property.\" This policy also covers forced labor (all work or service, not voluntarily performed, that is obtained from an individual under threat of force or penalty) and harmful child labor (the employment of children that is economically exploitative, or is likely to be hazardous to, or interfere with, the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health, or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development).\n\nPolicy Against Slavery and Human Trafficking\n\nYokohama is developing policies and procedures that support the disclosure requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1714.43. Such policies and procedures may include:\n\nPublic disclosures of our policy against slavery and human trafficking, along with our activities implementing the same, on Yokohama's website;\n\nProcedures outlining what is expected from management, employees, and suppliers to better identify, prevent and mitigate the use of forced labor in our supply chain, including, but not limited to maintaining open lines of communication between these parties;\n\nA plan to initiate training for company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management focusing, among other things, on monitoring and mitigating risks related to the presence of slavery and human trafficking within the product supply chain;\n\nand Supporting compliance by suppliers with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which those suppliers operate with respect to the products or materials they supply. Such compliance includes:\n\nNot using forced or compulsory labor;\n\nEnsuring that overall terms of employment are voluntary;\n\nComplying with minimum age requirements prescribed by applicable laws or contracts;\n\nCompensating workers with wages and benefits that meet or exceed legally required minimums and overtime pay requirements;\n\nand Abiding by applicable law concerning the maximum hours of daily labor.\n\nYokohama may also require suppliers to certify to its compliance with the above requirements.\n\nYokohama will not continue to purchase goods or services from any supplier of which it is made aware to be engaging in human trafficking or using slave labor without proper cure or remedy of such practices. Yokohama is permitted to audit its suppliers' compliance with these policies. If the supplier is presenting a serious risk, the audit may be unannounced. Although Yokohama regularly monitors its suppliers for a variety of reasons, an audit is typically not performed to determine compliance with the prohibitions against slavery and human trafficking, nor are these audits typically conducted by third parties. Nevertheless, Yokohama will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim or indication that a supplier is engaging in human trafficking or slave labor.\n\nProcedures\n\nYokohama Tire Company fully supports the purpose and goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and opposes any use of slavery or human trafficking in the manufacture and distribution of our products. We have adopted an initial company policy condemning the use of slavery and human trafficking. We are continuing to develop this policy to include processes that will help identify, prevent and mitigate the impact of forced labor in our supply chain and that will hold our employees and suppliers appropriately accountable for the policy's implementation. Moreover,\n\nWe maintain open lines of communication with our suppliers, managers, employees, investors, customers, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe are evaluating our supplier agreements as well as the terms and conditions found in our standard purchase agreements to determine ways to ensure our suppliers are complying with our policy against slavery and human trafficking. Although neither we nor a third party currently evaluate our supply chains for risks associated with these practices, we are exploring the possibility of requiring direct suppliers to be responsible for monitoring the compliance of their own suppliers with our policy.\n\nWe are also considering how to properly provide training on our policy to our employees and managers on our policy and processes.\n\nAlthough we do not currently conduct audits of our suppliers, we are considering the role of internal audits and self-reporting by suppliers as a method of compliance. Independent auditors or unannounced audits are not currently employed but will be considered if the circumstances require.", "gold_answer": "Yes", "model_response": "FINAL ANSWER: Yes", "normalized_prediction": "Yes", "correct": true, "response_time": 0.7136509418487549}
