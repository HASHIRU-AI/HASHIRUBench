So, gas Q is PH3.\n2. **Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between PH3 and CuSO4:** Phosphine reacts with copper sulfate to produce copper phosphide, sulfuric acid, and copper(II) oxide. The balanced equation is:\n   $2PH_3 + 8CuSO_4 + 12H_2O \\rightarrow 8Cu + 2H_3PO_4 + 8H_2SO_4$\n3. **Calculate the moles of PH3 produced:** Use the given mass of white phosphorus (P4) and its molar mass to find the moles of P4.
