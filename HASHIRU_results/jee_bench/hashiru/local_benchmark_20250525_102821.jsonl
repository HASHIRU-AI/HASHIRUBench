Comparing this with the standard form $y^2 = 4ax$, we have $4a = 8$, so $a = 2$. The focus $F$ of the parabola is at $(a, 0) = (2, 0)$.\n\n2. **Analyze Point P:** The point $P$ is given as $(-2, 4)$.\n\n3. **Check Option (C):** The distance between $P(-2, 4)$ and $F(2, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{(2 - (-2))^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, option (C) is FALSE.\n\n4. **Tangents to the Parabola:** Let $Q(x_1, y_1)$ be a point on the parabola $y^2 = 8x$. The equation of the tangent at $Q$ is given by $yy_1 = 4(x + x_1)$. Since this tangent passes through $P(-2, 4)$, we have $4y_1 = 4(-2 + x_1)$, which simplifies to $y_1 = -2 + x_1$. Also, since $Q(x_1, y_1)$ lies on the parabola, we have $y_1^2 = 8x_1$. Substituting $x_1 = y_1 + 2$ into the parabola equation, we get $y_1^2 = 8(y_1 + 2)$, which simplifies to $y_1^2 - 8y_1 - 16 = 0$.\n\n5. **Solve for y1:** Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. Then $y_1 + y_2 = 8$ and $y_1y_2 = -16$. The coordinates of the points $Q$ and $Q'$ are $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $x_1 = y_1 + 2$ and $x_2 = y_2 + 2$.\n\n6. **Director Circle:** The locus of the point of intersection of perpendicular tangents to the parabola $y^2 = 4ax$ is $x = -a$. In our case, $a = 2$, so the director circle is $x = -2$. Since the point $P(-2, 4)$ lies on the director circle, the tangents $PQ$ and $PQ'$ are perpendicular. Therefore, the triangle $QPQ'$ is a right-angled triangle at $P$. So, option (B) is TRUE.\n\n7. **Line Joining Q and Q':** The equation of the line joining $Q(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q'(x_2, y_2)$ is $y(y_1 + y_2) = 4(x + x_1 + x_2)$. We know $y_1 + y_2 = 8$, $x_1 = y_1 + 2$ and $x_2 = y_2 + 2$, so $x_1 + x_2 = y_1 + y_2 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12$. Thus, the equation of the line $QQ'$ is $8y = 4(x + 12)$, which simplifies to $2y = x + 12$.\n    If the focus $F(2, 0)$ lies on this line, then $2(0) = 2 + 12$, which is $0 = 14$, which is FALSE. Therefore, option (D) is FALSE.\n\n8. **Check Option (A):** We need to check if the triangle $PFQ$ is a right-angled triangle. This means either $PF \\perp FQ$, $PQ \\perp FQ$ or $PQ \\perp PF$.\n    $P = (-2, 4)$, $F = (2, 0)$. The slope of $PF$ is $\\frac{4 - 0}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{4}{-4} = -1$.\n    $Q = (x_1, y_1)$, where $y_1$ is a root of $y_1^2 - 8y_1 - 16 = 0$.\n    Let's find the values of $y_1$. $y_1 = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 64}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{128}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm 8\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n    If $y_1 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2}$, then $x_1 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}$. So, $Q = (6 + 4\\sqrt{2}, 4 + 4\\sqrt{2})$.\n    If $y_1 = 4 - 4\\sqrt{2}$, then $x_1 = 6 - 4\\sqrt{2}$. So, $Q' = (6 - 4\\sqrt{2}, 4 - 4\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Slope of $FQ$ is $\\frac{4 + 4\\sqrt{2} - 0}{6 + 4\\sqrt{2} - 2} = \\frac{4 + 4\\sqrt{2}}{4 + 4\\sqrt{2}} = 1$.\n    Since the slope of $PF$ is $-1$ and the slope of $FQ$ is $1$, $PF \\perp FQ$.
