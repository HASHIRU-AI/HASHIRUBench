If the third digit is 2, the last digit can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the second digit is 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, then the third and fourth digits can be any of the 6 digits.\nIf the first two digits are 20, the number must be >= 2022. So the last two digits can be 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 40, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 60, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 70, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77.\nIf the first digit is 2, the second digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the second digit is 0, the third digit can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. If the third digit is 2, the fourth digit can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the second digit is 0, the third digit can be 3, 4, 6, 7. Then the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits.\nIf the second digit is 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, then the third and fourth digits can be any of the 6 digits.\nSo, if the first digit is 2, the second digit is 0, the third digit is 2, the fourth digit can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 (5 numbers).\nIf the first digit is 2, the second digit is 0, the third digit is 3, 4, 6, 7, the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits (4 * 6 = 24 numbers).\nIf the first digit is 2, the second digit is 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, the third digit can be any of the 6 digits, the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits (5 * 6 * 6 = 180 numbers).\nTotal numbers starting with 2: 5 + 24 + 180 = 209.\n\nCase 2: The thousands digit is 3.\nThe number is of the form 3XYZ, where X, Y, and Z can be any of the digits 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSo there are 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 numbers.\n\nCase 3: The thousands digit is 4.\nThe number is of the form 4XYZ, where X, Y, and Z can be any of the digits 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSince the number must be less than or equal to 4482, we have subcases:\n- 4000 to 4377:\nIf the second digit is 0, 2, 3, then the third and fourth digits can be any of the 6 digits.\nIf the second digit is 4, then we have to consider the third digit.\nIf the second digit is 0, 2, 3, then there are 3 * 6 * 6 = 108 numbers.\nIf the second digit is 4, then the third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the third digit is 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, then the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits.\nIf the third digit is 7, then the fourth digit can be 0, 2.\nIf the second digit is 4, the third digit is 0, 2, 3, the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits (3 * 6 = 18 numbers).\nIf the second digit is 4, the third digit is 4, the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits (6 numbers).\nIf the second digit is 4, the third digit is 6, the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits (6 numbers).\nIf the second digit is 4, the third digit is 7, the fourth digit can be 0, 2 (2 numbers).\nIf the second digit is 4, the third digit is 8, the fourth digit can be 0, 2.\nSo, if the first digit is 4, the second digit is 0, 2, 3, then the third and fourth digits can be any of the 6 digits.\nIf the first digit is 4, the second digit is 4, then the third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the first digit is 4, the second digit is 4, the third digit is 8, then the fourth digit can be 0, 1, 2.\nThe numbers are of the form 4XYZ.\nIf X is 0, 2, 3, then Y and Z can be any of the 6 digits. 3 * 6 * 6 = 108.\nIf X is 4, then Y can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf Y is 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, then Z can be any of the 6 digits. 5 * 6 = 30.\nIf Y is 7, then Z can be 0.\nIf Y is 8, then Z can be 0, 1, 2.\nSo, if the first digit is 4, the second digit is 0, 2, 3, then the third and fourth digits can be any of the 6 digits. 3 * 6 * 6 = 108.\nIf the first digit is 4, the second digit is 4, then the third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the third digit is 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, then the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits. 5 * 6 = 30.\nIf the third digit is 7, then the fourth digit can be 0.\nThe numbers are 4000-4377, 4400-4477, 4480-4482.\nIf the first digit is 4, the second digit is 0, 2, 3, then the third and fourth digits can be any of the 6 digits. 3 * 6 * 6 = 108.\nIf the first two digits are 44, then the third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the third digit is 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, then the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits. 5 * 6 = 30.\nIf the third digit is 7, then the fourth digit can be 0.\nIf the third digit is 8, then the fourth digit can be 0, 1, 2.\nThe numbers are 4000-4377, 4400-4477, 4480-4482.\n4000-4377: 4000, 4002, ..., 4377.\n4400-4477: 4400, 4402, ..., 4477.\n4480-4482: 4480, 4481, 4482.\nIf the first digit is 4, the second digit is 0, 2, 3, then the third and fourth digits can be any of the 6 digits. 3 * 6 * 6 = 108.\nIf the first two digits are 44, then the third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the third digit is 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, then the fourth digit can be any of the 6 digits. 5 * 6 = 30.\nIf the third digit is 7, then the fourth digit can be 0.\nIf the third digit is 8, then the fourth digit can be 0, 2.\nSo, 108 + 30 + 1 + 2 = 141.\nTotal = 209 + 216 + 141 = 566.\n\nThe numbers must be in the range [2022, 4482].\nCase 1: 2XYZ.
