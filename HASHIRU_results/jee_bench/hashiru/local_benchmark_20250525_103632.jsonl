Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the circuit, the flux is simply:\n\n$\\Phi = B \\cdot A = (B_0 + \\beta t)A$\n\nwhere $A$ is the area of the circuit. Therefore, the induced EMF is:\n\n$\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d}{dt}((B_0 + \\beta t)A) = -\\beta A$\n\nGiven $A = 1 \\mathrm{m}^2$ and $\\beta = 0.04 \\mathrm{Ts}^{-1}$, the induced EMF is:\n\n$\\mathcal{E} = -0.04 \\mathrm{V}$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the equation for the current**\n\nThe equation for an LC circuit with an EMF is:\n\n$L\\frac{dI}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}\\int I dt = \\mathcal{E}$\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to time, we get:\n\n$L\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \\frac{I}{C} = \\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt}$\n\nSince $\\mathcal{E}$ is constant, $\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt} = 0$. Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n$L\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \\frac{I}{C} = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the differential equation**\n\nThe general solution to this differential equation is:\n\n$I(t) = I_0 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n\nwhere $\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}$ is the angular frequency, $I_0$ is the amplitude of the current, and $\\phi$ is the phase constant.\n\nGiven $L = 0.1 \\mathrm{H}$ and $C = 10^{-3} \\mathrm{F}$, we have:\n\n$\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.1 \\times 10^{-3}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10^{-4}}} = 100 \\mathrm{rad/s}$\n\nSo, $I(t) = I_0 \\cos(100t + \\phi)$.\n\nTo find $I_0$ and $\\phi$, we need initial conditions. At $t=0$, we assume the initial current $I(0) = 0$ and the initial charge on the capacitor is also 0.\nSince $I(0) = 0$, we have:\n\n$0 = I_0 \\cos(\\phi)$\n\nThis implies that $\\phi = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Let's take $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Then,\n\n$I(t) = I_0 \\cos(100t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -I_0 \\sin(100t)$\n\nNow, we need to find $I_0$. We know that $L\\frac{dI}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}\\int I dt = \\mathcal{E}$.\nSince $I(t) = -I_0 \\sin(100t)$, we have $\\frac{dI}{dt} = -100I_0 \\cos(100t)$ and $\\int I dt = \\frac{I_0}{100} \\cos(100t)$.\nPlugging these into the equation, we get:\n\n$-100LI_0 \\cos(100t) + \\frac{I_0}{100C} \\cos(100t) = \\mathcal{E}$\n\n$I_0 \\cos(100t) (\\frac{1}{100C} - 100L) = \\mathcal{E}$\n\nThis equation must hold for all $t$. However, the left side is time-dependent, while the right side is constant. This indicates that the initial assumption of zero initial charge is incorrect.\n\nLet's go back to the original equation: $L\\frac{dI}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}\\int I dt = \\mathcal{E}$. Differentiating, we get $L\\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \\frac{I}{C} = 0$.\nThe general solution is $I(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B\\sin(\\omega t)$.\nSince $I(0) = 0$, we have $A = 0$, so $I(t) = B\\sin(\\omega t)$.\nThen, $\\frac{dI}{dt} = B\\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$ and $\\int I dt = -\\frac{B}{\\omega}\\cos(\\omega t)$.\nPlugging into the original equation: $LB\\omega \\cos(\\omega t) - \\frac{B}{C\\omega}\\cos(\\omega t) = \\mathcal{E}$.\n$B\\cos(\\omega t)(L\\omega - \\frac{1}{C\\omega}) = \\mathcal{E}$.\nSince $\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}$, $L\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$ and $\\frac{1}{C\\omega} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$.\nSo, $B\\cos(\\omega t)(\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}) = \\mathcal{E}$, which means $0 = \\mathcal{E}$, which is not true.\n\nLet's consider the charge $Q$ on the capacitor. Then $I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}$. The equation becomes:\n$L\\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + \\frac{Q}{C} = \\mathcal{E}$.\nThe homogeneous solution is $Q_h(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B\\sin(\\omega t)$.\nThe particular solution is $Q_p(t) = C\\mathcal{E}$.\nSo, $Q(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B\\sin(\\omega t) + C\\mathcal{E}$.\nAt $t=0$, $Q(0) = 0$, so $A + C\\mathcal{E} = 0$, which means $A = -C\\mathcal{E}$.\n$I(t) = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t) + B\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)$.\nAt $t=0$, $I(0) = 0$, so $B = 0$.\nThus, $Q(t) = -C\\mathcal{E}\\cos(\\omega t) + C\\mathcal{E} = C\\mathcal{E}(1 - \\cos(\\omega t))$.\n$I(t) = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = C\\mathcal{E}\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)$.\n$I(t) = 10^{-3} \\times (-0.04) \\times 100 \\sin(100t) = -0.004\\sin(100t)$.\nThe maximum current is $0.004 \\mathrm{A} = 4 \\mathrm{mA}$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 4\n", "only_final_answer": "4", "full_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Consider an LC circuit, with inductance $L=0.1 \\mathrm{H}$ and capacitance $C=10^{-3} \\mathrm{~F}$, kept on a plane.
