A negative Q-value indicates that the reaction is endothermic and requires energy input.\n2.  **Account for the kinetic energy:** Since the nitrogen nucleus is at rest, the kinetic energy of the alpha particle must be greater than the absolute value of the Q-value to initiate the reaction. However, not all of the kinetic energy of the alpha particle is available for the reaction because some of it is converted into kinetic energy of the products to conserve momentum.\n3.  **Determine the minimum kinetic energy:**  To find the minimum kinetic energy needed, we need to account for the conservation of momentum. The formula for the minimum kinetic energy (threshold energy) in the lab frame is:\n\n    $KE_{min} = -Q (1 + \\frac{m_\\alpha}{m_N})$\n\n    where:\n    *   $Q$ is the Q-value of the reaction\n    *   $m_\\alpha$ is the mass of the alpha particle\n    *   $m_N$ is the mass of the nitrogen nucleus\n\nLet's start by calculating the Q-value.\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'action': 'get_all_memories'}, name='MemoryManager'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Memory retrieved successfully\",\n  \"output\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"vegetarian\",\n      \"memory\": \"The user is vegetarian.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"resume_data\",\n      \"memory\": \"Kunal Pai is a Computer Science student at UC Davis, expected to graduate with an MS in June 2026 (GPA 4.0/4.0) and a BS in June 2023 (GPA 3.8/4.0).
