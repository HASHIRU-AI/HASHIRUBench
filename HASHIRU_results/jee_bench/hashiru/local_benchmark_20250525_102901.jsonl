The critical points are x = 1, 2, ..., 21.  We need to determine where f1'(x) changes sign.  This occurs when (x-j)^j changes sign, which happens when j is odd.  The odd values of j between 1 and 21 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21.  There are 11 of these.\n\nNow, let's analyze the sign changes.\n- For x < 1, f1'(x) is negative since (x-1)^1 is negative and all other terms (x-j)^j are positive or zero.\n- At x = 1, f1'(x) changes from negative to positive, so x = 1 is a local minimum.\n- At x = 3, f1'(x) changes from positive to negative, so x = 3 is a local maximum.\n- At x = 5, f1'(x) changes from negative to positive, so x = 5 is a local minimum.\nThe pattern is: local minimum, local maximum, local minimum, ...\n\nSince there are 11 sign changes, and the first one is a local minimum, there are (11+1)/2 = 6 local minima and (11-1)/2 = 5 local maxima.\nSo, m1 = 6 and n1 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze f2(x)**\n\nf2(x) = 98(x-1)^50 - 600(x-1)^49 + 2450\nf2'(x) = 98 * 50 * (x-1)^49 - 600 * 49 * (x-1)^48\nf2'(x) = 4900(x-1)^49 - 29400(x-1)^48\nf2'(x) = 4900(x-1)^48 * (x-1 - 6)\nf2'(x) = 4900(x-1)^48 * (x-7)\n\nThe critical points are x = 1 and x = 7.\n\nf2''(x) = 4900 * 48 * (x-1)^47 * (x-7) + 4900 * (x-1)^48\nf2''(x) = 4900(x-1)^47 * [48(x-7) + (x-1)]\nf2''(x) = 4900(x-1)^47 * (49x - 337)\n\nAt x = 1, f2''(1) = 0.  The second derivative test is inconclusive.  However, since f2'(x) = 4900(x-1)^48 * (x-7), we see that f2'(x) is negative for x < 7 (except at x=1 where it is 0).  Thus, f2(x) is decreasing until x = 7.  At x = 1, f2'(x) does not change sign, so x = 1 is neither a local minimum nor a local maximum.\n\nAt x = 7, f2''(7) = 4900 * 6^47 * (49*7 - 337) = 4900 * 6^47 * (343 - 337) = 4900 * 6^47 * 6 > 0.
