The number and location of nodes are crucial in determining the type and energy of the molecular orbital.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n    *   **(A) $\\sigma$ orbital has a total of two nodal planes.**  A sigma ($\\sigma$) bonding orbital formed from 2pz orbitals is formed by constructive interference along the internuclear axis (z-axis). It has cylindrical symmetry and no nodal planes. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **(B) $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital has one node in the $x z$-plane containing the molecular axis.** A sigma antibonding ($\\sigma^{*}$) orbital formed from 2pz orbitals has a node between the two nuclei, perpendicular to the internuclear axis (xy-plane). The xz-plane contains the molecular axis, and the $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital does *not* have a node in this plane. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **(C) $\\pi$ orbital has one node in the plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axis and goes through the center of the molecule.**  Pi ($\\pi$) orbitals are formed by the sideways overlap of p orbitals.  Since we are starting with $2p_z$ orbitals, they will form $\\sigma$ orbitals. Thus, $\\pi$ orbitals are not formed in this case. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **(D) $\\pi^{*}$ orbital has one node in the $x y$-plane containing the molecular axis.** Pi antibonding ($\\pi^{*}$) orbitals have a nodal plane along the internuclear axis. However, since we are starting with $2p_z$ orbitals, they will form $\\sigma$ orbitals. Thus, $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals are not formed in this case. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate the problem:** The question states that the molecular orbitals are formed by the overlap of two $2p_z$ orbitals. This means that the $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ orbitals are formed. The $\\pi$ and $\\pi^*$ orbitals are formed by the overlap of $2p_x$ or $2p_y$ orbitals. Therefore, options (C) and (D) are incorrect.\n\n5.  **Corrected Analysis:**\n\n    *   **(A) $\\sigma$ orbital has a total of two nodal planes.**  A sigma ($\\sigma$) bonding orbital formed from 2pz orbitals is formed by constructive interference along the internuclear axis (z-axis). It has cylindrical symmetry and no nodal planes. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **(B) $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital has one node in the $x z$-plane containing the molecular axis.** A sigma antibonding ($\\sigma^{*}$) orbital formed from 2pz orbitals has a node between the two nuclei, perpendicular to the internuclear axis (xy-plane). The xz-plane contains the molecular axis, and the $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital does *not* have a node in this plane. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. The node is in the xy-plane.\n\nLet's use the `WikipediaTool` to confirm the nodal properties of sigma and sigma star orbitals formed from p orbitals.\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content":
