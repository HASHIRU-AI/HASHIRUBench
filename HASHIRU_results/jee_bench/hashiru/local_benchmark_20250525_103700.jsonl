The Coulomb repulsion affects protons, reducing their binding energy compared to neutrons.\n\nThe Coulomb energy is proportional to the number of proton pairs, which is $Z(Z-1)/2$.  The Coulomb potential energy is inversely proportional to the radius of the nucleus, which is proportional to $A^{1/3}$. Therefore, the Coulomb energy is proportional to $Z(Z-1)/(2A^{1/3})$.  Since the difference in binding energies $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is primarily due to the Coulomb repulsion, we can say that $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is proportional to $Z(Z-1)/A^{1/3}$.\n\nStatement (A) says $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is proportional to $Z(Z-1)$. This is not entirely correct, as it omits the $A^{-1/3}$ dependence.\n\nStatement (B) says $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is proportional to $A^{-1/3}$.  This is plausible, as the Coulomb energy is inversely proportional to the nuclear radius, which scales as $A^{1/3}$. The factor $Z(Z-1)$ is also important, but for a given range of nuclei, it may be approximately proportional to A. So, this statement could be correct.\n\nStatement (C) says $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is positive. Since the Coulomb repulsion reduces the binding energy of protons, $E_b^p$ will be smaller than $E_b^n$. Therefore, $E_b^p - E_b^n$ will be negative. So, this statement is incorrect.\n\nStatement (D) says $E_b^p$ increases if the nucleus undergoes a beta decay emitting a positron. In positron emission, a proton is converted into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. This reduces the number of protons ($Z$ decreases) and increases the number of neutrons ($N$ increases). Since the Coulomb repulsion is reduced, the binding energy of the remaining protons will increase. So, this statement is correct.\n\nTo verify the relationship between $E_b^p - E_b^n$ and $A^{-1/3}$, I will search for information on the semi-empirical mass formula (Bethe-Weizs\u00e4cker formula).\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'question': 'Bethe-Weizs\u00e4cker formula'}, name='WikipediaTool'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Wikipedia article summary retrieved successfully.\",\n  \"output\": \"**Semi-empirical mass formula**\nIn nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF; sometimes also called the Weizs\u00e4cker formula, Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker formula, or Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker mass formula to distinguish it from the Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker process) is used to approximate the mass of an atomic nucleus from its number of protons and neutrons As the name suggests, it is based partly on theory and partly on empirical measurements The formula represents the liquid-drop model proposed by George Gamow,[1] which can account for most of the terms in the formula and gives rough estimates for the values of the coefficients It was first formulated in 1935 by German physicist Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker,[2] and although refinements have been made to the coefficients over the years, the structure of the formula remains the same today The formula gives a good approximation for atomic masses and thereby other effects...\n[Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula)\"\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `WikipediaTool` with \n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Bethe-Weizs\u00e4cker formula\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='WikipediaTool', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Wikipedia article summary retrieved successfully.', 'output': '**Semi-empirical mass formula**\\nIn nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF; sometimes also called the Weizs\u00e4cker formula, Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker formula, or Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker mass formula to distinguish it from the Bethe\u2013Weizs\u00e4cker process) is used to approximate the mass of an atomic nucleus from its number of protons and neutrons As the name suggests, it is based partly on theory and partly on empirical measurements The formula represents the liquid-drop model proposed by George Gamow,[1] which can account for most of the terms in the formula and gives rough estimates for the values of the coefficients It was first formulated in 1935 by German physicist Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker,[2] and although refinements have been made to the coefficients over the years, the structure of the formula remains the same today The formula gives a good approximation for atomic masses and thereby other effects...\\n[Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula)'}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bethe-Weizs\u00e4cker formula includes a Coulomb term that is proportional to $Z(Z-1)/A^{1/3}$.
