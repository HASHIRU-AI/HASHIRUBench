Iron is dissolved in HCl, and the resulting Fe2+ solution is titrated with KMnO4. We need to find the number of moles of Fe2+ in the original solution and the percentage of iron in the sample.\n2.  **Write the balanced equation:** The reaction between Fe2+ and KMnO4 is a redox reaction. In acidic solution, MnO4- is reduced to Mn2+, and Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+. The balanced equation is:\n    $5 \\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} + \\mathrm{MnO}_4^- + 8 \\mathrm{H}^+ \\rightarrow 5 \\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + \\mathrm{Mn}^{2+} + 4 \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$\n3.  **Calculate moles of KMnO4 used in the titration:** We are given the volume and molarity of KMnO4 used in the titration.\n4.  **Calculate moles of Fe2+ in the 25.0 mL aliquot:** From the balanced equation, we can determine the mole ratio between Fe2+ and KMnO4.\n5.  **Calculate moles of Fe2+ in the 250 mL solution:** Since the 25.0 mL aliquot is a part of the 250 mL solution, we can scale up the moles of Fe2+ accordingly.\n6.  **Calculate the weight of iron in the sample:** Using the molar mass of iron, we can convert the moles of Fe2+ to grams of iron.\n7.  **Calculate the percentage of iron in the sample:** Divide the weight of iron by the weight of the sample and multiply by 100.\n8.  **Extract x and y:** From the calculated values, identify x and y.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate moles of KMnO4 used in the titration:**\n\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'query': 'moles calculation formula'}, name='GoogleSearchTool'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Search completed successfully\",\n  \"output\": [\n    \"https://byjus.com/number-of-moles-formula/\",\n    \"https://www.omnicalculator.com/chemistry/mole\",\n    \"https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Anoka-Ramsey_Community_College/Introduction_to_Chemistry/06%3A_Chemical_Composition/6.05%3A_Mole_Calculations\",\n    \"https://centraltutors.co.uk/mole-calculations-explained-formula-mass-and-mole-calculations/\",\n    \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74-X94OP2XI\",\n    \"https://www.ausetute.com.au/massmole.html\",\n    \"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/molar-calculations.html\",\n    \"https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/chemistry/cie/23/revision-notes/3-stoichiometry/3-2-the-mole-and-the-avogadro-constant/3-2-2-linking-moles-mass-and-mr/\",\n    \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zmgj2nb/revision/3\",\n    \"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/introduction-to-compounds/v/worked-example-calculating-molar-mass-and-number-of-moles\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `GoogleSearchTool` with \n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"moles calculation formula\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='GoogleSearchTool', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Search completed successfully', 'output': ['https://byjus.com/number-of-moles-formula/', 'https://www.omnicalculator.com/chemistry/mole', 'https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Anoka-Ramsey_Community_College/Introduction_to_Chemistry/06%3A_Chemical_Composition/6.05%3A_Mole_Calculations', 'https://centraltutors.co.uk/mole-calculations-explained-formula-mass-and-mole-calculations/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74-X94OP2XI', 'https://www.ausetute.com.au/massmole.html', 'https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/molar-calculations.html', 'https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/chemistry/cie/23/revision-notes/3-stoichiometry/3-2-the-mole-and-the-avogadro-constant/3-2-2-linking-moles-mass-and-mr/', 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zmgj2nb/revision/3', 'https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/introduction-to-compounds/v/worked-example-calculating-molar-mass-and-number-of-moles']}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Moles = Molarity x Volume (in Liters)\nMoles of KMnO4 = 0.03 M x (12.5 mL / 1000 mL/L) = 0.000375 moles\n\n**Step 4: Calculate moles of Fe2+ in the 25.0 mL aliquot:**\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 5 moles of Fe2+ react with 1 mole of KMnO4.\nMoles of Fe2+ = 5 x Moles of KMnO4 = 5 x 0.000375 moles = 0.001875 moles\n\n**Step 5: Calculate moles of Fe2+ in the 250 mL solution:**\n\nThe 25.0 mL aliquot contains 0.001875 moles of Fe2+.
