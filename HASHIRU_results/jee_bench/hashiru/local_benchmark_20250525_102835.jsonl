This means $x \\geq 0$ and $x \\leq 4 - y^2$.  The boundary of this region is the parabola $x = 4 - y^2$ and the y-axis.\n\n2. **Visualize the Problem:** Imagine circles centered on the x-axis that are contained within this region. We want to find the largest such circle.\n\n3. **Formulate the Problem:** Let the circle have center $(a, 0)$ and radius $r$. The equation of the circle is $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = r^2$.  Since the circle is contained in R, it must be tangent to the parabola $x = 4 - y^2$.  We want to find the values of $a$ and $r$ that maximize $r$ subject to the constraint that the circle is tangent to the parabola.\n\n4. **Tangency Condition:**  At the point of tangency $(\\alpha, \\beta)$, the circle and the parabola have the same slope.  The slope of the parabola is given by differentiating $x = 4 - y^2$ with respect to $x$: $1 = -2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, so $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{2y}$. The slope of the circle is given by differentiating $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = r^2$ with respect to $x$: $2(x-a) + 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$, so $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x-a}{y}$.  Therefore, at the point of tangency, we have $-\\frac{1}{2\\beta} = -\\frac{\\alpha - a}{\\beta}$, which simplifies to $1 = 2(\\alpha - a)$, or $\\alpha = a + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n5. **Point on Both Curves:** Since $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is on both the circle and the parabola, we have:\n    * $(\\alpha - a)^2 + \\beta^2 = r^2$\n    * $\\beta^2 = 4 - \\alpha$\n\n6. **Substitute and Solve:** Substitute $\\alpha = a + \\frac{1}{2}$ into the equations:\n    * $(a + \\frac{1}{2} - a)^2 + \\beta^2 = r^2  \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{4} + \\beta^2 = r^2$\n    * $\\beta^2 = 4 - (a + \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{7}{2} - a$\n\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    * $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{7}{2} - a = r^2  \\Rightarrow r^2 = \\frac{15}{4} - a$\n\n7. **Constraint on a:** Since the circle is contained in R, the x-coordinate of the center must be non-negative, so $a \\geq 0$. Also, the radius must be less than or equal to the x-intercept of the parabola, which is 4. So $a+r \\le 4$.\n\n8. **Maximize r:** We want to maximize $r$. Since $r^2 = \\frac{15}{4} - a$, we want to minimize $a$. The smallest possible value for $a$ is 0.  If $a = 0$, then $r^2 = \\frac{15}{4}$, so $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}$.  However, we need to check if the circle is contained in R.  If $a=0$, then $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\beta^2 = \\frac{7}{2}$, so $\\beta = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{2}}$.  The equation of the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = \\frac{15}{4}$.\n\n9. **Consider Tangency at x=4:** The circle could also be tangent to the parabola at the vertex $(4,0)$. In this case, the circle would have center $(a,0)$ and radius $r=4-a$. The equation of the circle is $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = (4-a)^2$. We also have $x = 4-y^2$. Substituting, we get $(4-y^2 - a)^2 + y^2 = (4-a)^2$. Expanding, we get $(4-a)^2 - 2(4-a)y^2 + y^4 + y^2 = (4-a)^2$. This simplifies to $y^4 + (1-2(4-a))y^2 = 0$, or $y^2(y^2 + 1 - 8 + 2a) = 0$, or $y^2(y^2 + 2a - 7) = 0$. For tangency, we need $2a-7=0$, so $a = \\frac{7}{2}$. Then $r = 4 - \\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n10. **Final Check:** Comparing the two radii, $\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\approx 1.936$ and $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.  Since we want the largest radius, we choose $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}$. However, we need to ensure that the circle is contained in the region. If $a=0$, the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = \\frac{15}{4}$. The parabola is $x = 4-y^2$. At the intersection, $x^2 + 4-x = \\frac{15}{4}$, so $x^2 - x + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$, so $(x-\\frac{1}{2})^2 = 0$, so $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $y^2 = 4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$, so $y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{2}}$. Thus, the circle is tangent to the parabola at $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{2}})$.
