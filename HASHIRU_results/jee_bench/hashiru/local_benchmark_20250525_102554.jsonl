The aniline then reacts with HCl to form anilinium chloride, which is the organic salt.\n3.  **Calculate the moles of the organic salt:**  The molar mass of anilinium chloride (C6H5NH3Cl) is 129 g/mol.  Since 1.29 g of the salt is produced, the number of moles is 1.29 g / 129 g/mol = 0.01 mol.\n4.  **Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction:** The balanced equation for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline by SnCl2 is:\n    3SnCl2 + 2C6H5NO2 + 6HCl -> 3SnCl4 + 2C6H5NH3Cl + 2H2O\n    From the equation, 2 moles of nitrobenzene produce 2 moles of anilinium chloride.
