However, since multiple sources point to a non-integer value for n, it is possible that there is an error in the problem statement or the expected answer format.\n\nSince I have thoroughly checked my calculations and consulted external resources, and I am still arriving at the same non-integer value for $n$, I will proceed with the calculation and provide the closest integer value.\n\n$n = \\frac{23}{10 \\cdot 2^{2/3}} \\approx 1.448$\n\nThe closest integer to 1.448 is 1. However, since the problem statement says $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10n}{15^{1/3}}}$, and we have $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{23}{2^{2/3} 15^{1/3}}}$, we can write $10n = \\frac{23}{2^{2/3}}$.\nIf $n=2$, then $20 = \\frac{23}{2^{2/3}}$, which is not true.\n\nLet's assume that the answer is an integer.
