Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n\nWe are given:\n\n*   |F \u222a C| = 330\n*   |C \u222a B| = 350\n*   |F \u222a B| = 340\n*   |F \u2229 C \u2229 B| = 30\n\nWe want to find the number of people with at most one symptom. This is equivalent to finding:\n\n900 - (number of people with two or three symptoms)\n\nFirst, let's find the number of people with *exactly* one symptom. To do this, we'll use the following formulas derived from the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\n\n*   |F \u222a C| = |F| + |C| - |F \u2229 C|  =>  |F \u2229 C| = |F| + |C| - |F \u222a C| = 190 + 220 - 330 = 80\n*   |C \u222a B| = |C| + |B| - |C \u2229 B|  =>  |C \u2229 B| = |C| + |B| - |C \u222a B| = 220 + 220 - 350 = 90\n*   |F \u222a B| = |F| + |B| - |F \u2229 B|  =>  |F \u2229 B| = |F| + |B| - |F \u222a B| = 190 + 220 - 340 = 70\n\nNow, let's find the number of people with *exactly* two symptoms:\n\n*   Only Fever and Cough: |F \u2229 C| - |F \u2229 C \u2229 B| = 80 - 30 = 50\n*   Only Cough and Breathing Problem: |C \u2229 B| - |F \u2229 C \u2229 B| = 90 - 30 = 60\n*   Only Fever and Breathing Problem: |F \u2229 B| - |F \u2229 C \u2229 B| = 70 - 30 = 40\n\nNumber of people with exactly two symptoms = 50 + 60 + 40 = 150\n\nNumber of people with three symptoms = 30\n\nNumber of people with two or three symptoms = 150 + 30 = 180\n\nNumber of people with at most one symptom = 900 - 180 = 720\n\n**3.
