Momentum Conservation**\n\nSince the initial nucleus N is at rest, the total momentum is zero.

Kinetic Energy in terms of Masses and Total Kinetic Energy**\n\nFrom momentum conservation, we have $M_P v_P = M_Q v_Q$.  We can write the kinetic energies as:\n\n$E_P = \\frac{1}{2} M_P v_P^2$ and $E_Q = \\frac{1}{2} M_Q v_Q^2$\n\nAlso, $E_P + E_Q = \\delta c^2$.  We want to express $E_P$ in terms of the masses and $\\delta c^2$.  From momentum conservation, $v_Q = \\frac{M_P}{M_Q} v_P$.  Substituting this into the expression for $E_Q$:\n\n$E_Q = \\frac{1}{2} M_Q \\left(\\frac{M_P}{M_Q} v_P\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{M_P^2}{M_Q} v_P^2 = \\frac{M_P}{M_Q} E_P$\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy conservation equation:\n\n$E_P + \\frac{M_P}{M_Q} E_P = \\delta c^2$\n\n$E_P \\left(1 + \\frac{M_P}{M_Q}\\right) = \\delta c^2$\n\n$E_P \\left(\\frac{M_Q + M_P}{M_Q}\\right) = \\delta c^2$\n\n$E_P = \\frac{M_Q}{M_P + M_Q} \\delta c^2$\n\nSo, statement (B) is incorrect.\n\n**4. Magnitude of Momentum**\n\nLet $p$ be the magnitude of the momentum of both P and Q. Then $p = M_P v_P = M_Q v_Q$.\nWe have $E_P = \\frac{p^2}{2M_P}$ and $E_Q = \\frac{p^2}{2M_Q}$.\nSince $E_P + E_Q = \\delta c^2$, we have $\\frac{p^2}{2M_P} + \\frac{p^2}{2M_Q} = \\delta c^2$.\n$p^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2M_P} + \\frac{1}{2M_Q}\\right) = \\delta c^2$\n$p^2 \\left(\\frac{M_P + M_Q}{2M_P M_Q}\\right) = \\delta c^2$\n$p^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{M_P M_Q}{M_P + M_Q}\\right) \\delta c^2 = 2 \\mu \\delta c^2$\n$p = c \\sqrt{2 \\mu \\delta}$\n\nSo, statement (D) is correct.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A, C, D\n", "only_final_answer": "A, C, D", "full_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "A heavy nucleus $N$, at rest, undergoes fission $N \\rightarrow P+Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are two lighter nuclei.
