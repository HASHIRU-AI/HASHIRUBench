A circle of radius 'r' touches the sides AB, AC, and the circumcircle of triangle ABC internally. We need to find the value of 'r'.\n\n2. **Find the Circumradius of Triangle ABC:** Since triangle ABC is right-angled at A, the circumcenter is the midpoint of the hypotenuse BC. We can find BC using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   BC = sqrt(AB^2 + AC^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(10)\n   The circumradius R is half of BC: R = BC/2 = sqrt(10)/2\n\n3. **Analyze the Geometry:** Let the circle with radius 'r' have center O. Since it touches AB and AC, O must lie on the angle bisector of angle BAC. Since angle BAC is 90 degrees, the distance from O to AB and AC is 'r'. Therefore, the coordinates of O can be represented as (r, r) with A as the origin.\n\n4. **Coordinates of the Circumcenter:**  Let A be (0,0), B be (1,0), and C be (0,3). The midpoint of BC, which is the circumcenter, has coordinates ((1+0)/2, (0+3)/2) = (1/2, 3/2).\n\n5. **Distance between Centers:** The distance between the center of the smaller circle (r, r) and the circumcenter (1/2, 3/2) is equal to the difference between the circumradius and the radius of the smaller circle:\n   sqrt((r - 1/2)^2 + (r - 3/2)^2) = R - r = sqrt(10)/2 - r\n\n6. **Solve for r:** Square both sides of the equation:\n   (r - 1/2)^2 + (r - 3/2)^2 = (sqrt(10)/2 - r)^2\n   r^2 - r + 1/4 + r^2 - 3r + 9/4 = 10/4 - sqrt(10)r + r^2\n   r^2 - 4r + 10/4 = 10/4 - sqrt(10)r\n   r^2 - 4r + sqrt(10)r = 0\n   r(r - 4 + sqrt(10)) = 0\n   Since r > 0, we have r = 4 - sqrt(10)\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\nFINAL ANSWER: 4 - sqrt(10)\n", "only_final_answer": "4 - sqrt(10)", "full_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Let $A B C$ be the triangle with $A B=1, A C=3$ and $\\angle B A C=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.
