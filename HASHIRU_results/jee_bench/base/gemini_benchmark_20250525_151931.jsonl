They have the same radius $R$, and their masses are related by $M_{B}=2 M_{A}$.\n\nInitially, $M_A = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\rho_A$ and $M_B = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\rho_B$. Since $M_B = 2 M_A$, we have $\\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\rho_B = 2 \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\rho_A$, which implies $\\rho_B = 2 \\rho_A$.\n\nAfter the interaction, star $A$ loses some mass such that its radius is halved, while its density remains $\\rho_A$. Let the new radius of $A$ be $R_A' = \\frac{R}{2}$. The new mass of $A$ is $M_A' = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (\\frac{R}{2})^3 \\rho_A = \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\rho_A = \\frac{1}{8} M_A$.\nThe mass lost by $A$ is $M_A - M_A' = M_A - \\frac{1}{8} M_A = \\frac{7}{8} M_A$.\n\nThe entire mass lost by $A$ is deposited as a thick spherical shell on $B$ with density $\\rho_A$. Let the outer radius of the new star $B$ be $R_B'$. The mass of the shell is $M_{shell} = \\frac{7}{8} M_A$. The volume of the shell is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (R_B'^3 - R^3)$. Since the density of the shell is $\\rho_A$, we have $M_{shell} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (R_B'^3 - R^3) \\rho_A$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{7}{8} M_A = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (R_B'^3 - R^3) \\rho_A$. Substituting $M_A = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\rho_A$, we get\n$\\frac{7}{8} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\rho_A = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (R_B'^3 - R^3) \\rho_A$.\n$\\frac{7}{8} R^3 = R_B'^3 - R^3$, so $R_B'^3 = R^3 + \\frac{7}{8} R^3 = \\frac{15}{8} R^3$.\nThus, $R_B' = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{15}{8}} R = \\frac{15^{1/3}}{2} R$.\n\nThe new mass of $B$ is $M_B' = M_B + M_{shell} = 2 M_A + \\frac{7}{8} M_A = \\frac{16+7}{8} M_A = \\frac{23}{8} M_A$.\n\nThe escape velocity from $A$ is $v_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_A'}{R_A'}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G (\\frac{1}{8} M_A)}{\\frac{R}{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_A}{2 R}}$.\nThe escape velocity from $B$ is $v_B = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_B'}{R_B'}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G (\\frac{23}{8} M_A)}{\\frac{15^{1/3}}{2} R}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{23 G M_A}{2 \\cdot 15^{1/3} R}}$.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{23 G M_A}{2 \\cdot 15^{1/3} R}}{\\frac{G M_A}{2 R}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{23}{15^{1/3}}}$.\nWe are given that $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10 n}{15^{1/3}}}$. Comparing the two expressions, we have\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{23}{15^{1/3}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10 n}{15^{1/3}}}$.\nTherefore, $23 = 10n$, so $n = \\frac{23}{10}$.\n\nThe problem statement gives $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10 n}{15^{1/3}}}$. So, we have $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{23}{15^{1/3}}}$. Thus, we have $\\frac{10n}{15^{1/3}} = \\frac{23}{15^{1/3}}$, so $10n = 23$, which means $n = \\frac{23}{10} = 2.3$.\n\nThus we have $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{23}{15^{1/3}}}$, and $\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10n}{15^{1/3}}}$. Thus $23 = 10n$, so $n = 2.3$. But we need to give integer as answer.
