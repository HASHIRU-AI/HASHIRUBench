The first digit can be 2, 3, or 4.\n\nIf the first digit is 2:\nThe second digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the second digit is 0:\nThe third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the third digit is 0:\nThe fourth digit can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. (5 choices)\nIf the third digit is 2:\nThe fourth digit can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. (5 choices)\nIf the third digit is 3, 4, 6, 7:\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. (6 choices each)\nSo there are $5+5+4 \\cdot 6 = 10 + 24 = 34$ integers when the first two digits are 20.\n\nIf the second digit is 2:\nThe third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSo there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ integers when the first two digits are 22.\n\nIf the second digit is 3:\nThe third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSo there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ integers when the first two digits are 23.\n\nIf the second digit is 4:\nThe third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSo there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ integers when the first two digits are 24.\n\nIf the second digit is 6:\nThe third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSo there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ integers when the first two digits are 26.\n\nIf the second digit is 7:\nThe third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSo there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ integers when the first two digits are 27.\nIn total, if the first digit is 2, then there are $34 + 5 \\cdot 36 = 34 + 180 = 214$ integers.\n\nIf the first digit is 3:\nThe other three digits can be anything. Thus, there are $6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = 216$ integers.\n\nIf the first digit is 4:\nThe second digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4.\nIf the second digit is 0, 2, 3:\nThe other two digits can be anything. Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = 3 \\cdot 36 = 108$ integers.\nIf the second digit is 4:\nThe third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nIf the third digit is 0, 2, 3:\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\nSo there are $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$ integers.\nIf the third digit is 4:\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2. Thus, there are 2 integers.\nIf the third digit is 6, 7:\nThe fourth digit can be anything. Thus, there are 0 integers.\nWe need integers from 4400 to 4482.\nThe numbers are 4400, 4402, 4403, 4404, 4406, 4407, 4420, 4422, 4423, 4424, 4426, 4427, 4430, 4432, 4433, 4434, 4436, 4437, 4440, 4442, 4443, 4444, 4446, 4447, 4460, 4462, 4463, 4464, 4466, 4467, 4470, 4472, 4473, 4474, 4476, 4477, 4482.\nSo the third digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. The number must be $\\le 4482$.\nIf the third digit is 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, the fourth digit can be 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Thus, 5*6 = 30.\nIf the third digit is 4:\nThe fourth digit can be 0, 2. Thus, there are 2.\nThen we have 4482.\nThe numbers from 4400 to 4482 are 4400, 4402, 4403, 4404, 4406, 4407, ..., 4477.\nThe numbers are 4400, 4402, 4403, 4404, 4406, 4407, 4420, 4422, 4423, 4424, 4426, 4427, ..., 4470, 4472, 4473, 4474, 4476, 4477.\nAlso 4482. Total $30+2+1 = 33$.\nIf the first digit is 4, then the total is $108 + 33 = 141$.\n\nTherefore, the total is $214+216+141 = 571$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 571", "only_final_answer": "571", "response_time": 8.04686713218689, "is_correct": false}
