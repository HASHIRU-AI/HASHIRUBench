ONLY give the final answer letter(s) or number(s) without any additional text or explanation.", "target_answer": "AD", "agent_final_response": "Here's my attempt to determine the correct answer:\n\n*   **Galena:** Galena is lead(II) sulfide, PbS.\n*   **Reaction with HNO3:** When PbS reacts with HNO3, the following reaction occurs:\n    PbS + 8HNO3 \u2192 Pb(NO3)2 + H2SO4 + 8NO2 + 4H2O\n\nThe gas produced is nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Now, let's analyze the properties of NO2:\n\n*   **Paramagnetic:** NO2 has an odd number of electrons (17 valence electrons), making it paramagnetic due to the presence of an unpaired electron.\n*   **Bent geometry:** NO2 has a bent structure.\n*   **Acidic oxide:** NO2 is an acidic oxide because it reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitrous acid: 2NO2 + H2O \u2192 HNO3 + HNO2\n*   **Color:** NO2 is a reddish-brown gas.\n\nConsidering the properties of NO2, the correct properties are paramagnetic, bent geometry, and an acidic oxide. The question asks which one the gas *is*.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: (A)", "only_final_answer": "(A)", "response_time": 2.0150949954986572, "is_correct": false}
