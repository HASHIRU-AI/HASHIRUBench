{"sample_index": 9, "description": "JEE Adv 2021 Paper 2", "subject": "phy", "input_prompt": "A pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m=0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ and a massless inextensible string of length $L=1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. It is suspended from a fixed point at height $H=0.9 \\mathrm{~m}$ above a frictionless horizontal floor. Initially, the bob of the pendulum is lying on the floor at rest vertically below the point of suspension. A horizontal impulse $P=0.2 \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$ is imparted to the bob at some instant. After the bob slides for some distance, the string becomes taut and the bob lifts off the floor. The magnitude of the angular momentum of the pendulum about the point of suspension just before the bob lifts off is $J \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{s}$. The kinetic energy of the pendulum just after the liftoff is $K$ Joules. What is the value of $J$?\n\nSolve the above question. You MUST NOT ask the user for clarifications.

Initial Velocity and Kinetic Energy:**\n\n*   The horizontal impulse `P` gives the bob an initial velocity `v = P/m = 0.2 kg.m/s / 0.1 kg = 2 m/s`.\n*   The initial kinetic energy of the bob is `KE = (1/2) * m * v^2 = (1/2) * 0.1 kg * (2 m/s)^2 = 0.2 J`.\n\n**2. Sliding Distance:**\n\n*   The bob slides horizontally until the string becomes taut.  The horizontal distance it slides is irrelevant to finding the angular momentum just *before* liftoff.\n\n**3. Angular Momentum Just Before Liftoff:**\n\n*   Just before the string becomes taut and the bob lifts off, the bob is still moving horizontally with velocity `v = 2 m/s`.\n*   The distance of the bob from the pivot point is `L = 1 m`.\n*   The angular momentum `J` about the point of suspension is given by `J = m * v * L = 0.1 kg * 2 m/s * 1 m = 0.2 kg.m^2/s`.\n\n**4. Kinetic Energy Just After Liftoff**\n*   After lift off, we need to calculate the velocity of the bob\n*   Energy is conserved after lift off, and can be converted to potential energy, meaning that velocity can be lower.\n*   When string becomes taut, velocity component parallel to string becomes 0 and only component perpendicular to the string remains (impulsive force).\n*   So, if $\\theta$ is the angle between the string and horizontal, $v_{\\perp} = v\\sin\\theta$.\n*   We have $\\cos \\theta = 0.9 / 1 = 0.9$, meaning $\\sin \\theta = \\sqrt{1-0.9^2} = \\sqrt{0.19} = 0.4359$\n*   After string is taut, velocity is $v' = v\\sin \\theta = 2\\sqrt{0.19}$. KE is therefore equal to $K = (1/2)mv'^2 = (1/2)(0.1)*4*0.19 = 0.038 J$\n\n**5.
