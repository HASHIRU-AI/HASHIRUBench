We need to determine the dominant species and reactions to find the pH.\n\n2. **Neutralization reactions:**  The NaOH will react with the carbonic acid and bicarbonate. Let's consider the reactions step-by-step.\n   *  NaOH + H2CO3  -> NaHCO3 + H2O\n   *  NaOH + NaHCO3 -> Na2CO3 + H2O\n\n3. **Moles after reactions:**\n   * Initially:\n      * H2CO3 = 0.01 mol\n      * NaHCO3 = 0.01 mol\n      * Na2CO3 = 0.01 mol\n      * NaOH = 0.01 mol\n\n   * After the first reaction (NaOH + H2CO3 -> NaHCO3 + H2O):  Since we have equal moles of NaOH and H2CO3, they will completely react.\n      * H2CO3 = 0 mol\n      * NaHCO3 = 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02 mol\n      * Na2CO3 = 0.01 mol\n      * NaOH = 0 mol\n\n4. **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** Now we have a buffer solution containing HCO3- and CO32-. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The relevant equilibrium is:\n\n   HCO3-  <=> H+  + CO32-\n\n   pH = pKa2 + log ([CO32-] / [HCO3-])\n   pH = 10.32 + log (0.01 / 0.02)\n   pH = 10.32 + log (1/2)\n   pH = 10.32 + log (0.5)\n   pH = 10.32 - log 2\n   pH = 10.32 - 0.30\n   pH = 10.02\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 10.02.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 10.02", "only_final_answer": "10.02", "response_time": 3.198212146759033, "is_correct": true}
