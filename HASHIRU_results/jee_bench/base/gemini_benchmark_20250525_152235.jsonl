It is multi-molecular (forms multilayers). It's exothermic, so decreasing temperature favors it. The enthalpy change is relatively low (20-40 kJ/mol).\n\n*   **Chemisorption (Chemical Adsorption):** Involves chemical bond formation. It results in a unimolecular layer. It's exothermic. It typically has a higher activation energy.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **(A) Chemisorption results in a unimolecular layer.** This is correct because chemisorption involves the formation of chemical bonds between the adsorbate and the surface, leading to a single layer.\n\n*   **(B) The enthalpy change during physisorption is in the range of 100 to $140 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.** This is incorrect. Physisorption involves weak van der Waals forces and has a low enthalpy change (typically in the range of 20-40 kJ/mol). The range given here is more typical of chemisorption.\n\n*   **(C) Chemisorption is an endothermic process.** This is incorrect. Chemisorption, like physisorption, is generally an exothermic process because bond formation releases energy.\n\n*   **(D) Lowering the temperature favors physisorption processes.** This is correct. Physisorption is an exothermic process, so lowering the temperature will shift the equilibrium towards adsorption, according to Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (D).\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A, D", "only_final_answer": "A, D", "response_time": 2.487189769744873, "is_correct": true}
