Analyze the Lamp:**\n\n*   Power consumed by the lamp, P = 500 W\n*   Voltage across the lamp, V\\_lamp = 100 V\n\nWe can calculate the current through the lamp (and thus the entire series circuit) using:\n\nP = V\\_lamp \\* I\n\nI = P / V\\_lamp = 500 W / 100 V = 5 A\n\n**2. Analyze the Circuit as a Whole:**\n\n*   Supply voltage, V = 200 V\n*   Since the lamp and capacitor are in series, the same current (I = 5 A) flows through both.\n\nWe can find the voltage across the capacitor using the Pythagorean theorem, considering the voltages as phasors:\n\nV^2 = V\\_lamp^2 + V\\_C^2\n\n200^2 = 100^2 + V\\_C^2\n\n40000 = 10000 + V\\_C^2\n\nV\\_C^2 = 30000\n\nV\\_C = $\\sqrt{30000}$ = 100$\\sqrt{3}$ V\n\n**3.
