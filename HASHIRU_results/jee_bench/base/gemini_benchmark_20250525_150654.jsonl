The formula for the observed frequency ($f'$) when the source is moving towards a stationary observer is:\n\n$f' = f_s \\cdot \\frac{v}{v - u}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $f_s$ is the frequency of the source\n*   $v$ is the speed of sound in air\n*   $u$ is the speed of the source\n\nNext, we need to determine the resonant frequencies of the pipe. Since one end of the pipe is closed, the fundamental frequency ($f_0$) is given by:\n\n$f_0 = \\frac{v}{4L}$\n\nThe resonant frequencies for a pipe closed at one end are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency:\n\n$f_n = (2n - 1)f_0$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nSo, the resonant frequencies are $f_0, 3f_0, 5f_0,$ and so on.\n\nFor resonance to occur, the frequency heard by the pipe ($f'$) must match one of the resonant frequencies of the pipe. Let's examine each option:\n\n**(A)  u = 0.8v and f<sub>s</sub> = f<sub>0</sub>**\n\n$f' = f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{v - 0.8v} = f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{0.2v} = 5f_0$\n\nSince $5f_0$ is a resonant frequency of the pipe, option A leads to resonance.\n\n**(B) u = 0.8v and f<sub>s</sub> = 2f<sub>0</sub>**\n\n$f' = 2f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{v - 0.8v} = 2f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{0.2v} = 10f_0$\n\n$10f_0$ is not a resonant frequency (it's an even multiple, and only odd multiples are resonant), so option B does not lead to resonance.\n\n**(C) u = 0.8v and f<sub>s</sub> = 0.5f<sub>0</sub>**\n\n$f' = 0.5f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{v - 0.8v} = 0.5f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{0.2v} = 2.5f_0$\n\n$2.5f_0$ is not a resonant frequency, so option C does not lead to resonance.\n\n**(D) u = 0.5v and f<sub>s</sub> = 1.5f<sub>0</sub>**\n\n$f' = 1.5f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{v - 0.5v} = 1.5f_0 \\cdot \\frac{v}{0.5v} = 3f_0$\n\nSince $3f_0$ is a resonant frequency of the pipe, option D leads to resonance.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A, D", "only_final_answer": "A, D", "response_time": 4.004744052886963, "is_correct": true}
