We want to find the radius $r$ of a circle that touches the sides $AB$ and $AC$ and also touches the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ internally.\n\nSince $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, its circumcircle has its center at the midpoint of the hypotenuse $BC$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $BC = \\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{10}$. Thus, the radius of the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$ is $R = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. The center of the circumcircle is the midpoint of $BC$.\n\nLet the circle with radius $r$ have its center at $O$. Since the circle touches sides $AB$ and $AC$, its center $O$ must lie on the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$, which is at $45^\\circ$ to both $AB$ and $AC$. Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(0,0)$, $B$ be $(1,0)$, and $C$ be $(0,3)$. Then the center $O$ has coordinates $(r,r)$.\n\nLet $O_1$ be the center of the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$. Then $O_1$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so its coordinates are $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\right)$. The distance between the centers $O$ and $O_1$ is $R - r = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2} - r$.\nThus, we have the distance formula:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\left(r-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(r-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2} - r $$\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n$$ \\left(r-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(r-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2} - r\\right)^2 $$\n$$ r^2 - r + \\frac{1}{4} + r^2 - 3r + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{10}{4} - r\\sqrt{10} + r^2 $$\n$$ 2r^2 - 4r + \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{10}{4} - r\\sqrt{10} + r^2 $$\n$$ r^2 - 4r + r\\sqrt{10} = 0 $$\nSince $r > 0$, we can divide by $r$:\n$$ r - 4 + \\sqrt{10} = 0 $$\n$$ r = 4 - \\sqrt{10} $$\n\nTherefore, $r = 4 - \\sqrt{10}$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: $4-\\sqrt{10}$", "only_final_answer": "$4-\\sqrt{10}$", "response_time": 3.7289421558380127, "is_correct": false}
