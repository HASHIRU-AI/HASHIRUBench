The Coulomb force is repulsive between protons.  Neutrons, being neutral, do not experience Coulomb repulsion. Therefore, the binding energy of a proton will be reduced compared to that of a neutron due to the Coulomb interaction with the other protons in the nucleus.\n\nThe Coulomb energy of a nucleus with $Z$ protons, assuming a uniform charge distribution in a sphere of radius $R$, is given by\n$$E_C = \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{Z(Z-1)e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R}$$\nwhere $R = r_0 A^{1/3}$, with $r_0 \\approx 1.2 \\text{ fm}$.\n\nThe binding energy of a proton will be reduced by the average Coulomb potential it experiences. The difference in the binding energies between a proton and a neutron can be estimated as:\n$$E_b^p - E_b^n \\approx -\\frac{\\partial E_C}{\\partial Z} \\approx -\\frac{3}{5} \\frac{(2Z-1)e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R} \\approx -\\frac{3}{5} \\frac{2Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_0 A^{1/3}}$$\nThis implies $E_b^p - E_b^n \\propto -\\frac{Z}{A^{1/3}}$. Since the result is negative, $E_b^p < E_b^n$.\n\n(A) $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is proportional to $Z(Z-1)$.  Since $E_b^p - E_b^n \\propto -Z/A^{1/3}$, this statement is incorrect.\n\n(B) $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is proportional to $A^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.  Since $E_b^p - E_b^n \\propto -Z/A^{1/3}$, for a fixed $Z$, this statement could be correct in approximation. If we assume that $Z\\approx \\frac{A}{2}$, then $E_b^p - E_b^n \\propto -\\frac{A}{2A^{1/3}} \\propto -A^{2/3}$ which means $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is not simply proportional to $A^{-1/3}$. However, $E_b^p-E_b^n$ is proportional to $\\frac{Z}{A^{1/3}}$. Since Z varies slower than A, $E_b^p - E_b^n$ has some relation to $A^{-1/3}$.\n\n(C) $E_b^p - E_b^n$ is positive. This is incorrect since $E_b^p - E_b^n < 0$ because of the Coulomb repulsion.\n\n(D) $E_b^p$ increases if the nucleus undergoes a beta decay emitting a positron.\nPositron emission is $p \\rightarrow n + e^+ + \\nu_e$. This reduces the number of protons by 1, hence reducing the Coulomb repulsion. As a result, $E_b^p$ becomes less negative, which means the binding energy of the original proton increases in absolute value (becomes more negative) if we consider the binding energy of that specific proton that transformed to a neutron. However, the average binding energy of a proton in the new nucleus is larger (less negative) than it was previously. Hence $E_b^p$ of other protons in the new nucleus will increase.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: B, D", "only_final_answer": "B, D", "response_time": 4.791784048080444, "is_correct": false}
