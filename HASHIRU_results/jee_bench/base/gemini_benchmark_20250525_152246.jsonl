This process involves dissolving alumina in molten cryolite ($\\mathrm{Na}_{3} \\mathrm{AlF}_{6}$) and electrolyzing the mixture. This lowers the melting point and allows electrolysis to occur at a manageable temperature.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **(A):**  The reaction of $\\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$ with coke (C) at high temperatures is a carbothermic reduction. While possible in theory, it's not the primary method for aluminum extraction due to the formation of aluminum carbide and the high temperatures required.\n\n*   **(B):** This describes part of the Bayer process, which is used to purify bauxite ore *before* electrolysis. It removes impurities by dissolving alumina in NaOH and then precipitating it as hydrated alumina.\n\n*   **(C):**  This is also part of the Bayer process, the first step in purifying bauxite.\n\n*   **(D):** This option closely describes the Hall-H\u00e9roult process. It mentions the electrolysis of $\\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$ mixed with $\\mathrm{Na}_{3} \\mathrm{AlF}_{6}$. The products are aluminum and oxygen (not $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).\n\nFINAL ANSWER: (D)", "only_final_answer": "(D)", "response_time": 2.616384983062744, "is_correct": false}
