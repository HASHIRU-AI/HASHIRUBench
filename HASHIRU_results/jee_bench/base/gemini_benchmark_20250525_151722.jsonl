The normal vector of $P_1$ is $\\mathbf{n}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 15 \\\\ 12 \\end{pmatrix}$ and the normal vector of $P_2$ is $\\mathbf{n}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The direction vector of the line of intersection is\n\\[\n\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{n}_1 \\times \\mathbf{n}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 15 \\\\ 12 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (15)(4) - (12)(5) \\\\ (12)(-2) - (10)(4) \\\\ (10)(5) - (15)(-2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 60 - 60 \\\\ -24 - 40 \\\\ 50 + 30 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -64 \\\\ 80 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThis vector is parallel to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nNow, we need to find a point on the line of intersection. To do this, let $x = 0$. Then we have\n\\begin{align*} 15y + 12z &= 60 \\\\ 5y + 4z &= 20 \\end{align*}\nThese equations are identical. So let $y = 4$. Then $15(4) + 12z = 60$, so $60 + 12z = 60$, which gives $z = 0$. Thus $(0, 4, 0)$ is a point on the line of intersection. The equation of the line of intersection is $\\frac{x}{0} = \\frac{y-4}{-4} = \\frac{z}{5}$. Since the line of intersection of the two planes cannot be an edge of the tetrahedron, we are looking for a line that is not parallel to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and does not lie on both planes.\n\n(A) The direction vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$. The point is $(1, 1, 1)$.\n$10(1) + 15(1) + 12(1) - 60 = 10 + 15 + 12 - 60 = 37 - 60 = -23 \\neq 0$, so it is not on $P_1$.\n$-2(1) + 5(1) + 4(1) - 20 = -2 + 5 + 4 - 20 = 7 - 20 = -13 \\neq 0$, so it is not on $P_2$.\nThis line is not parallel to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$. So it can be an edge of the tetrahedron.\n\n(B) The direction vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. The point is $(6, 0, 0)$.\n$10(6) + 15(0) + 12(0) - 60 = 60 - 60 = 0$, so it is on $P_1$.\n$-2(6) + 5(0) + 4(0) - 20 = -12 - 20 = -32 \\neq 0$, so it is not on $P_2$.\nThis line is not parallel to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$. So it can be an edge of the tetrahedron.\n\n(C) The direction vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The point is $(0, 4, 0)$.\n$10(0) + 15(4) + 12(0) - 60 = 60 - 60 = 0$, so it is on $P_1$.\n$-2(0) + 5(4) + 4(0) - 20 = 20 - 20 = 0$, so it is on $P_2$.\nThis line lies on both planes, so it is the line of intersection, and it cannot be an edge of the tetrahedron.\n\n(D) The direction vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. The point is $(0, 4, 0)$.\n$10(0) + 15(4) + 12(0) - 60 = 60 - 60 = 0$, so it is on $P_1$.\n$-2(0) + 5(4) + 4(0) - 20 = 20 - 20 = 0$, so it is on $P_2$.\nLet the line be $x = t$, $y = 4 - 2t$, $z = 3t$.\n$10x + 15y + 12z - 60 = 10t + 15(4 - 2t) + 12(3t) - 60 = 10t + 60 - 30t + 36t - 60 = 16t$.\nFor the line to lie on $P_1$, we must have $16t = 0$, so $t = 0$, which means the line is just the point $(0, 4, 0)$.\nHowever, $-2x + 5y + 4z - 20 = -2t + 5(4 - 2t) + 4(3t) - 20 = -2t + 20 - 10t + 12t - 20 = 0$.\nSo this line lies on the plane $P_2$. So this line cannot be an edge of the tetrahedron.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) and (B).\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A,B", "only_final_answer": "A,B", "response_time": 7.376584053039551, "is_correct": false}
