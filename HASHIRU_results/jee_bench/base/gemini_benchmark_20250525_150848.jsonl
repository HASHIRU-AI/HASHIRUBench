Fe(III) has a $d^5$ configuration.  $Cl^{-}$ is a weak field ligand, so it forms a high-spin complex. Therefore, $\\left[\\mathrm{FeCl}_{4}\\right]^{-}$ is tetrahedral.\n\n$\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CO})_{4}\\right]^{2-}$: Fe is in -2 oxidation state. The electronic configuration is Fe(-2) is $d^{10}$. Since CO is a strong field ligand, it forms tetrahedral complex. Hence,  $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CO})_{4}\\right]^{2-}$ is tetrahedral.\n\n(B) $\\left[\\mathrm{Co}(\\mathrm{CO})_{4}\\right]^{-}$: Co is in -1 oxidation state, electronic configuration is $d^{10}$ thus it is tetrahedral.\n\n$\\left[\\mathrm{CoCl}_{4}\\right]^{2-}$: Co is in +2 oxidation state. Co(II) has a $d^7$ configuration. $Cl^{-}$ is a weak field ligand. Therefore,  $\\left[\\mathrm{CoCl}_{4}\\right]^{2-}$ is tetrahedral.\n\n(C) $\\left[\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{CO})_{4}\\right]$: Ni is in 0 oxidation state, electronic configuration is $d^{10}$. Since CO is a strong field ligand, it forms tetrahedral complex.\n\n$\\left[\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{CN})_{4}\\right]^{2-}$: Ni is in +2 oxidation state. Ni(II) has a $d^8$ configuration. $CN^{-}$ is a strong field ligand, it forms square planar complex.\n\n(D) $\\left[\\mathrm{Cu}(\\mathrm{py})_{4}\\right]^{+}$: Cu is in +1 oxidation state, electronic configuration is $d^{10}$.
