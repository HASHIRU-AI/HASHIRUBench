{"sample_index": 10, "description": "JEE Adv 2021 Paper 2", "subject": "phy", "input_prompt": "A pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m=0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ and a massless inextensible string of length $L=1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. It is suspended from a fixed point at height $H=0.9 \\mathrm{~m}$ above a frictionless horizontal floor. Initially, the bob of the pendulum is lying on the floor at rest vertically below the point of suspension. A horizontal impulse $P=0.2 \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$ is imparted to the bob at some instant. After the bob slides for some distance, the string becomes taut and the bob lifts off the floor. The magnitude of the angular momentum of the pendulum about the point of suspension just before the bob lifts off is $J \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{s}$. The kinetic energy of the pendulum just after the liftoff is $K$ Joules. What is the value of $K$?\n\nSolve the above question. You MUST NOT ask the user for clarifications.

Initial Velocity and Kinetic Energy**\n\n*   The impulse $P$ imparted to the bob gives it an initial horizontal velocity $v_0$ such that $P = mv_0$. Thus, $v_0 = P/m = 0.2/0.1 = 2 \\mathrm{~m/s}$.\n*   The initial kinetic energy of the bob is $KE_0 = (1/2)mv_0^2 = (1/2)(0.1)(2^2) = 0.2 \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n**2. Velocity Just Before Liftoff**\n\n*   As the bob slides horizontally, its velocity remains constant until the string becomes taut. Therefore, the velocity of the bob just before the string becomes taut is still $v_0 = 2 \\mathrm{~m/s}$.\n\n**3. Angular Momentum Just Before Liftoff**\n\n*   Just before liftoff, the bob is a distance $L = 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ horizontally from the point of suspension.  The angular momentum $J$ about the point of suspension is given by $J = r \\times p$, where $r$ is the position vector from the pivot to the mass, and $p$ is the linear momentum. The magnitude of the angular momentum is $J = mr v_0$, where $r$ is the length of the string.\n    *   $J = (0.1 \\mathrm{~kg})(1.0 \\mathrm{~m})(2 \\mathrm{~m/s}) = 0.2 \\mathrm{~kg}-\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**4. Velocity Just After Liftoff**\n\n*   When the string becomes taut, the component of the bob's velocity along the string is reduced to zero instantaneously. Only the component of the velocity perpendicular to the string remains.  Let $v'$ be the velocity of the bob just after the string becomes taut.\n*   Since angular momentum is conserved during the impulsive tightening of the string, the angular momentum just after liftoff is equal to the angular momentum just before liftoff. Let $v'$ be the velocity of the bob just after liftoff, which is perpendicular to the string.  Then, $J = m L v'$.\n    *   $0.2 = (0.1)(1)v'$, so $v' = 2 \\mathrm{~m/s}$.\n*   The kinetic energy just after liftoff is $K = (1/2) m v'^2 = (1/2) (0.1) (2^2) = 0.2 \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n**Therefore, the kinetic energy of the pendulum just after liftoff is 0.2 J.**\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 0.2", "only_final_answer": "0.2", "response_time": 3.7046568393707275, "is_correct": false}
