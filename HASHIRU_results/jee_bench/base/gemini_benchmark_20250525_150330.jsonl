We want to determine the behavior of $f(x)$ for $x \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n\nConsider the function $g(x) = e^{-2x} f(x)$. Then,\n$$g'(x) = -2 e^{-2x} f(x) + e^{-2x} f'(x) = e^{-2x} (f'(x) - 2f(x)).$$\nSince $f'(x) > 2f(x)$, we have $f'(x) - 2f(x) > 0$. Therefore, $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which means that $g(x)$ is an increasing function.\nSince $g(x)$ is increasing, for $x > 0$, we have $g(x) > g(0)$.\nWe have $g(0) = e^{-2(0)} f(0) = e^0 (1) = 1$.\nThus, $g(x) > 1$ for $x > 0$.\nTherefore, $e^{-2x} f(x) > 1$, which implies $f(x) > e^{2x}$ for $x > 0$.\nThis means that option [C] is correct.\n\nSince $f(x) > e^{2x}$ for $x > 0$, $f(x)$ is increasing in $(0, \\infty)$, so option [A] is also correct.\n\nNow we need to check option [D]. Since $f'(x) > 2f(x)$ and $f(x) > e^{2x}$ for $x > 0$, we have $f'(x) > 2f(x) > 2e^{2x}$ for $x > 0$. So $f'(x) > 2e^{2x}$ for $x > 0$, which means that $f'(x)$ is not less than $e^{2x}$. Thus, option [D] is incorrect.\n\nFrom $f(x) > e^{2x}$ for $x>0$, we can deduce that $f(x)$ is increasing on $(0,\\infty)$. To see this, consider $x_1, x_2 \\in (0,\\infty)$ with $x_1 < x_2$. Then $e^{2x_1} < e^{2x_2}$, so $f(x_1) > e^{2x_1}$ and $f(x_2) > e^{2x_2}$.\nHowever, we know that $g(x) = e^{-2x}f(x)$ is increasing, so $e^{-2x_1} f(x_1) < e^{-2x_2} f(x_2)$, which implies $e^{2x_2} f(x_1) < e^{2x_1} f(x_2)$. We cannot directly conclude that $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ from this.\n\nHowever, $g'(x) > 0$ means that $f'(x) > 2f(x)$, so $f'(x) > 2e^{2x} > 0$ for $x > 0$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is increasing in $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: [A, C]", "only_final_answer": "[A, C]", "response_time": 4.374718189239502, "is_correct": true}
