Reaction of Sn with HCl:**\n\n*   Sn reacts with HCl to form SnCl2 (Stannous chloride).\n*   The balanced equation is:  Sn + 2HCl -> SnCl2 + H2\n\n**2. Reaction of SnCl2 with Nitrobenzene:**\n\n*   SnCl2 reduces nitrobenzene to aniline in the presence of HCl.  The aniline then reacts with HCl to form anilinium chloride, which is the organic salt.\n*   The balanced equation for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline:\n    2 C6H5NO2 + 3 SnCl2 + 6 HCl \u2192 2 C6H5NH2 + 3 SnCl4 + 2 H2O\n*   The aniline reacts with HCl to form anilinium chloride:\n    C6H5NH2 + HCl -> C6H5NH3Cl\n\n**3. Stoichiometry and Calculations:**\n\n*   Molar mass of anilinium chloride (C6H5NH3Cl) = 129 g/mol\n*   Moles of anilinium chloride formed = 1.29 g / 129 g/mol = 0.01 mol\n*   Since 2 moles of nitrobenzene produce 2 moles of aniline, and therefore 2 moles of anilinium chloride, the moles of nitrobenzene reacted = 0.01 mol.\n*   Molar mass of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) = 123 g/mol\n*   Mass of nitrobenzene reacted (y) = 0.01 mol * 123 g/mol = 1.23 g\n\nTherefore, the value of y is 1.23.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 1.23", "only_final_answer": "1.23", "response_time": 2.630011796951294, "is_correct": true}
