This salt reacts with nitrobenzene to form an organic salt. Let's analyze the reactions.\n\nThe reaction of Sn with HCl will produce SnCl2 or SnCl4.\nSn + 2HCl -> SnCl2 + H2\nSn + 4HCl -> SnCl4 + 2H2\n\nNitrobenzene reacts with SnCl2/SnCl4 in the presence of HCl to form anilinium chloride, which is the organic salt.\nC6H5NO2 + 3SnCl2 + 6HCl -> C6H5NH3Cl + 3SnCl4 + 2H2O\nC6H5NO2 + 3SnCl4 + 6HCl + 2H2O -> C6H5NH3Cl + 3SnCl4(OH)2  (Not likely to happen)\nC6H5NO2 + 3Sn + 6HCl -> C6H5NH2 + 3SnCl2 + 2H2O  ->  C6H5NH3+ Cl-\nC6H5NO2 + Sn + HCl -> C6H5NH3Cl + SnCl_x\n\nThe organic salt formed is anilinium chloride (C6H5NH3Cl). The molar mass of anilinium chloride is:\n6(12) + 5(1) + 14 + 3(1) + 35 = 72 + 5 + 14 + 3 + 35 = 129 g/mol\nGiven that 1.29 g of anilinium chloride is formed, the number of moles of anilinium chloride formed is:\n1.29 g / 129 g/mol = 0.01 mol\n\nThe balanced reaction is:\nC6H5NO2 + 3SnCl2 + 6HCl -> C6H5NH3Cl + 3SnCl4 + 2H2O\nFrom the reaction, 1 mole of nitrobenzene reacts with 3 moles of SnCl2 to produce 1 mole of anilinium chloride.\nHowever, Sn first reacts with HCl to give SnCl2 or SnCl4. SnCl2 is more likely as SnCl4 would react with nitrobenzene in an entirely different fashion.\nSn + 2HCl -> SnCl2 + H2\nFrom the stoichiometry of the second reaction:\nC6H5NO2 + 3SnCl2 + 6HCl -> C6H5NH3Cl + 3SnCl4 + 2H2O\nThe mole ratio between anilinium chloride and SnCl2 is 1:3. Since 0.01 mol of anilinium chloride is formed, 3 * 0.01 = 0.03 mol of SnCl2 is required.\nFrom the first reaction:\nSn + 2HCl -> SnCl2 + H2\nThe mole ratio between Sn and SnCl2 is 1:1. Therefore, 0.03 mol of Sn is required.\nThe mass of Sn required is:\n0.  03 mol * 119 g/mol = 3.57 g\nSo, x = 3.57\n\nAnother reaction (assuming nitrobenzene undergoes reduction to aniline)\nC6H5NO2 + 3Sn + 7HCl  ->  C6H5NH3Cl + 3SnCl2+ 2H2O\nor\nC6H5NO2 + 3Sn + 7HCl  -> C6H5NH3Cl + 3SnCl2 + 2H2O\nMoles of C6H5NH3Cl = 1.29 /129 = 0.01\n3Sn required per mole of C6H5NH3Cl\nmoles of Sn = 3 * moles of C6H5NH3Cl = 3*0.01 = 0.03\nmass of Sn = 0.03*119 = 3.57\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 3.57", "only_final_answer": "3.57", "response_time": 4.87221622467041, "is_correct": true}
