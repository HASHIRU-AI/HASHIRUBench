This is the region to the right of the $y$-axis and inside the parabola $x = 4 - y^2$.\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be the family of all circles that are contained in $R$ and have centers on the $x$-axis. We want to find the circle $C$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ that has the largest radius. Let the center of this circle be $(a, 0)$ and the radius be $r$. The equation of the circle is $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = r^2$. Since the circle is contained in $R$, we must have $a \\geq r$ and the circle must be inside the parabola $x = 4 - y^2$.\n\nWe want to find the largest $r$ such that $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = r^2$ and $x = 4 - y^2$. Substituting $y^2 = 4 - x$ into the circle equation, we get $(x-a)^2 + 4 - x = r^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + 4 - x = r^2$. Thus, $x^2 - (2a+1)x + (a^2+4-r^2) = 0$.\nSince the circle is tangent to the parabola, the quadratic equation must have a unique solution. Therefore, the discriminant must be zero:\n$D = (2a+1)^2 - 4(a^2+4-r^2) = 0$\n$4a^2 + 4a + 1 - 4a^2 - 16 + 4r^2 = 0$\n$4a + 1 - 16 + 4r^2 = 0$\n$4a - 15 + 4r^2 = 0$\n$4r^2 = 15 - 4a$\n$r^2 = \\frac{15-4a}{4}$\n$r = \\frac{\\sqrt{15-4a}}{2}$\nSince $r>0$, we must have $15-4a>0$, so $4a < 15$ or $a < \\frac{15}{4}$. Also, since the circle is in $R$, we must have $a \\geq r$. So, $a \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{15-4a}}{2}$, which means $4a^2 \\geq 15 - 4a$, so $4a^2 + 4a - 15 \\geq 0$. Factoring, we get $(2a+5)(2a-3) \\geq 0$. Since $a \\geq 0$, we have $2a - 3 \\geq 0$, so $a \\geq \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nTo maximize $r$, we can maximize $r^2 = \\frac{15-4a}{4}$. Since $r^2$ is a decreasing function of $a$, we want to minimize $a$. The smallest possible value of $a$ is $3/2$.\nThus, $a = \\frac{3}{2}$, and $r^2 = \\frac{15-4(3/2)}{4} = \\frac{15-6}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}$. So $r = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe equation of the circle is $(x - \\frac{3}{2})^2 + y^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$.\nWe want to find the intersection point of the circle and the parabola:\n$(x - \\frac{3}{2})^2 + (4-x) = \\frac{9}{4}$\n$x^2 - 3x + \\frac{9}{4} + 4 - x = \\frac{9}{4}$\n$x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$\n$(x-2)^2 = 0$\n$x = 2$\nThus, $\\alpha = 2$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 2", "only_final_answer": "2", "response_time": 5.325756072998047, "is_correct": true}
