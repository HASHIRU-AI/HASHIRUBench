It has cylindrical symmetry and concentrates electron density between the nuclei. The \u03c3 bonding orbital from 2pz orbitals has NO nodal planes perpendicular to the internuclear axis. Statement A is incorrect.\n\n*   **\u03c3\\* (sigma antibonding) orbital:** This is formed by destructive overlap along the internuclear axis. It has a nodal plane perpendicular to the internuclear axis and located between the nuclei. The \u03c3\\* antibonding orbital has one nodal plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axis. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.\n\n*   **\u03c0 (pi) orbital:** Two 2pz orbitals can also overlap sideways to form \u03c0 orbitals. One 2pz from each atom combine in phase and out of phase to form bonding \u03c0 and antibonding \u03c0* orbitals. The \u03c0 orbital formed by 2pz orbitals has electron density above and below the internuclear axis. It has a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis, which is the xz-plane. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.\n\n*   **\u03c0\\* (pi antibonding) orbital:** The \u03c0\\* antibonding orbital has the same nodal plane as the \u03c0 bonding orbital (the xz plane containing the molecular axis). Additionally, it has a nodal plane perpendicular to the internuclear axis. Statement D is incorrect.\n\nRe-examining the statements:\n\n*   (A) The \u03c3 orbital formed from 2pz orbitals has 0 nodal planes perpendicular to the molecular axis. It has cylindrical symmetry around the bond axis and thus no nodal plane. So this statement is false.\n*   (B) The \u03c3* orbital has one nodal plane perpendicular to the molecular axis (between the two nuclei). So this statement is false.\n*   (C) The \u03c0 orbital from combination of 2pz orbitals has a node containing the molecular axis, and does *not* have a node perpendicular to the molecular axis. Thus it is false.\n*   (D) We form \u03c0 orbitals from the sideways combination of 2pz. Thus they will have a node that contains the molecular axis. This plane would be the xz plane here (the molecular axis is z and we are using pz). So that statement is false.\n\nHowever, let's revisit the question and my understanding of the formation of \u03c0 orbitals. The two 2pz orbitals can also form \u03c0 orbitals through lateral overlap. These \u03c0 orbitals will indeed have electron density above and below the internuclear axis (which we can assume to be along the z-axis).\nFor \u03c0 orbitals formed by the combination of pz orbitals, the nodal plane is the plane containing the internuclear axis. Usually, when considering px and py orbitals forming pi bonds, the z-axis is typically taken as the internuclear axis. In this case, the pz orbitals lie *along* the internuclear axis, and sideways overlap does not form traditional \u03c0 orbitals. They form \u03c3 and \u03c3\\* orbitals instead. So C and D must be false. Let's look closely at statement B again:\n\n(B) $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital has one node in the $x z$-plane containing the molecular axis.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital will have a nodal plane perpendicular to the molecular axis, not *containing* the molecular axis. The xz-plane is along the molecular axis.\n\nTherefore, there is an error in all the answer choices. The correct answer is none of the options.\n\nSince no options are correct, let me reconsider the problem setup. The prompt states to select CORRECT statements. Given that all provided answer choices seem incorrect based on standard MO theory, I will assume there is a nuanced interpretation that leads to at least one correct statement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\n\n(A) $\\sigma$ orbital has a total of two nodal planes.\n\nA sigma bonding orbital from two pz orbitals actually has no nodes perpendicular to the internuclear axis. It's cylindrically symmetrical. So A is incorrect.\n\n(B) $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital has one node in the $x z$-plane containing the molecular axis.\n\nThis is wrong. The antibonding sigma orbital formed by the overlap of pz orbitals has one nodal plane *perpendicular* to the molecular axis (z-axis).\n\n(C) $\\pi$ orbital has one node in the plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axis and goes through the center of the molecule.\n\nWhen 2pz orbitals combine sideways, the resulting pi orbitals have a node that *contains* the molecular axis (the z axis). NOT perpendicular to it.\n\n(D) $\\pi^{*}$ orbital has one node in the $x y$-plane containing the molecular axis.\n\nThis is INCORRECT. The xy-plane is a perpendicular plane.\nIf we accept that *sideways* overlap of 2pz orbitals forms pi bonds, those pi bonds will have a node in the XZ plane containing the axis. The antibonding pi will *also* have a node that is perpendicular. Statement D implies that this plane is XY which is contradictory to what we expect since the bonding axis is along z.\n\nI believe the intent of the questions requires understanding that although the primary overlap of pz orbitals yields sigma bonds, there is also sideways overlap that yields pi interactions. Let's consider D again assuming the molecular axis is the z-axis:\n\n(D) $\\pi^{*}$ orbital has one node in the $x y$-plane containing the molecular axis.\n\nThe question seems to imply that the xy-plane *contains* the molecular axis, when it in fact is perpendicular to the molecular axis (z). Therefore D is wrong. I maintain the previous analysis. All choices are wrong.\n\nNone of the statements seem correct. There is likely an issue with the provided options.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: None", "only_final_answer": "None", "response_time": 7.531749963760376, "is_correct": false}
