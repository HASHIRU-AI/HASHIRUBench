When the projectile reaches its highest point, it enters a region where the effective acceleration due to gravity is $g' = \\frac{g}{0.81}$. We want to find the new range $d' = nd$.\n\nThe range of a projectile fired from horizontal ground with initial speed $v$ and projection angle $\\theta$ is given by $d = \\frac{v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}$.\n\nLet $T$ be the time to reach the highest point. Then $T = \\frac{v \\sin\\theta}{g}$. The horizontal distance covered until the highest point is $x_1 = v \\cos\\theta \\cdot T = \\frac{v^2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta}{g} = \\frac{v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{2g} = \\frac{d}{2}$.\n\nAt the highest point, the vertical velocity is 0. The horizontal velocity is $v \\cos\\theta$. The time to fall from the highest point under gravity $g'$ is given by $h = \\frac{1}{2} g' t^2$, where $h$ is the height. The height $h$ is given by $h = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g}$. Therefore,\n$\\frac{v^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g} = \\frac{1}{2} g' t^2 \\implies t^2 = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{g g'} = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{g \\cdot \\frac{g}{0.81}} = \\frac{0.81 v^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{g^2} \\implies t = \\frac{0.9 v \\sin\\theta}{g}$.\n\nThe horizontal distance covered during this time is $x_2 = v \\cos\\theta \\cdot t = v \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{0.9 v \\sin\\theta}{g} = \\frac{0.9 v^2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta}{g} = \\frac{0.9 v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{2g} = 0.9 \\frac{d}{2} = 0.45d$.\n\nThe new range is $d' = x_1 + x_2 = \\frac{d}{2} + 0.45d = 0.5d + 0.45d = 0.95d$.\nTherefore, $d' = 0.95d$, so $n = 0.95$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 0.95", "only_final_answer": "0.95", "response_time": 3.4388279914855957, "is_correct": true}
