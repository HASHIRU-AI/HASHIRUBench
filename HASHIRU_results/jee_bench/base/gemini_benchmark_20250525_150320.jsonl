We want to find the probability that $z$ is even.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of nonnegative integer solutions to $x+y+z=10$.\nBy stars and bars, the number of solutions is $\\binom{10+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11}{2 \\cdot 1} = 66$.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of solutions where $z$ is even. Let $z = 2k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$. Then we have $x+y+2k=10$, or $x+y = 10-2k$. Since $x, y \\ge 0$, we must have $10-2k \\ge 0$, so $2k \\le 10$, which means $k \\le 5$. Thus, $k$ can take the values $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nFor each value of $k$, the number of solutions to $x+y = 10-2k$ is $\\binom{(10-2k)+2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{11-2k}{1} = 11-2k$.\n\nSo, the number of solutions with $z$ even is\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^5 (11-2k) = 11+9+7+5+3+1 = 36. $$\n\nThe probability that $z$ is even is $\\frac{36}{66} = \\frac{6}{11}$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: [B]", "only_final_answer": "[B]", "response_time": 2.311486005783081, "is_correct": true}
