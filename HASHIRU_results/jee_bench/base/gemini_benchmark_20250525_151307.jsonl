Let the center of the circle be $(a,0)$ and the radius be $r$. Since the circle is contained in $R$, we must have $x \\geq 0$ and $y^2 \\leq 4-x$. The equation of the circle is $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = r^2$, or $y^2 = r^2 - (x-a)^2$.\nSince the circle is contained in $R$, we have $r^2 - (x-a)^2 \\leq 4-x$ for all $x$ such that $(x-a)^2 \\leq r^2$, i.e., $a-r \\leq x \\leq a+r$.\nSince $x \\geq 0$, we must have $a-r \\geq 0$.\nAlso, we must have $r^2 - (x-a)^2 \\leq 4-x$ for $a-r \\leq x \\leq a+r$.\nRearranging the inequality, we have $r^2 - (x-a)^2 \\leq 4-x$, or $(x-a)^2 \\geq x - 4 + r^2$.\nWe want the circle to be tangent to the curve $y^2 = 4-x$.\nSubstituting $y^2 = 4-x$ into $(x-a)^2 + y^2 = r^2$, we get $(x-a)^2 + 4-x = r^2$, which gives $x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + 4 - x = r^2$.\nThus, $x^2 - (2a+1)x + a^2 + 4 - r^2 = 0$.\nSince the circle is tangent to the curve, this quadratic equation must have exactly one solution. Therefore, the discriminant must be 0.\n$\\Delta = (2a+1)^2 - 4(a^2 + 4 - r^2) = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 - 4a^2 - 16 + 4r^2 = 4a + 4r^2 - 15 = 0$.\nSo, $4a + 4r^2 = 15$, which means $a = \\frac{15}{4} - r^2$.\nWe also need $a-r \\geq 0$, so $\\frac{15}{4} - r^2 - r \\geq 0$, which gives $15 - 4r^2 - 4r \\geq 0$, or $4r^2 + 4r - 15 \\leq 0$.\nFactoring, we have $(2r-3)(2r+5) \\leq 0$, so $-\\frac{5}{2} \\leq r \\leq \\frac{3}{2}$. Since $r>0$, we have $0 < r \\leq \\frac{3}{2}$.\nIf $r = \\frac{3}{2}$, then $a = \\frac{15}{4} - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{15}{4} - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe point of tangency is $x = \\frac{2a+1}{2} = \\frac{2(\\frac{3}{2}) + 1}{2} = \\frac{3+1}{2} = 2$.\nThen $y^2 = 4-x = 4-2 = 2$, so $y = \\pm \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe circle is $(x-\\frac{3}{2})^2 + y^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$.\nThe radius of the circle $C$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 3/2", "only_final_answer": "3/2", "response_time": 5.393134117126465, "is_correct": true}
