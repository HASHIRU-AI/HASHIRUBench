The paper title is: STREET: A MULTI-TASK STRUCTURED REASONING AND EXPLANATION BENCHMARK\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: A long pursuit in Artificial Intelligence is to endow machines with the ability to reason and manipulate premises to reach conclusions and perform tasks. Initially, most reasoning systems performed multistep operations over symbolic or probabilistic knowledge (Newell & Simon, 1956; McCarthy et al., 1960; Siler & Buckley, 2005), and even though these systems were able to perform complex tasks (Ribeiro & Forbus, 2021), there were still shortcomings when it comes to encoding such knowledge, learning reasoning rules and dealing with ambiguity (Bell, 1985; Ribeiro et al., 2019). Some recent works in the field of question-answering (QA) have demonstrated that language models can bypass some of these issues and learn to reason directly over natural language (Clark et al., 2020), allowing for more flexible and adaptable reasoning capabilities. Another advantage of performing multistep reasoning over natural language is that it allows for more inspectable outputs, improving the explainability of models that are otherwise regarded as black box systems (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Rajani et al., 2019a; Danilevsky et al., 2020). Despite the recent progress, we notice that there is still a gap in resources for training and evaluating general reasoning capabilities over natural language. To facilitate research in this direction we propose the STructured REasoning and Explanation Multi-Task benchmark (or STREET for short), containing a collection of tasks in various domains including quantitative reasoning (math questions), analytical reasoning (logic puzzle questions), and deductive reasoning (common-sense and science questions). We build upon existing QA datasets by adding multi-premise, multi-step, structured explanations in the form of reasoning graphs, as depicted in Figure 1. The STREET benchmark contains 35.8k questions, each of which is accompanied by a reasoning graph, either created by expert annotators or programmatically. When combined, all reasoning graphs contain a total of 151.1k reasoning steps (or textual entailments), of which 14.7k were created by our expert annotators. We carefully selected the tasks such that most of the relevant knowledge required to answer the questions is contained within the question or context themselves. Therefore, we focus on the reasoning problem, with a greater number of reasoning steps (an average of 7.8 reasoning steps per answer) and a more complex reasoning structure than previous datasets. These properties differentiate our work from single-step reasoning such as Natural Language Inference (NLI) (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2018) or multi-hop QA (Yang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2021) that require specific factual knowledge retrieval. In our proposed evaluation, the models are expected to not only answer the questions, but also generate the reasoning graphs (including the textual intermediate steps) that explains their output answer. With that in mind, we design a few evaluation metrics to verify if the generated reasoning graphs match the expected golden data. We perform extensive evaluation using some popular language models of various sizes, namely T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), either fine-tuning on training data or using few-shot prompting. Our experiments show that even though these models can achieve high solving rates on many of the original QA datasets, they still struggle to generate coherent and relevant reasoning graphs and appear to be far below human performance. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) We define reasoning graphs, which are structured chains of reasoning in natural language that provide explainability to the output of models on QA tasks. (2)We propose STREET, a multi-task and multi-domain benchmark containing questions requiring diverse types of reasoning skills. The answers in the dataset contain annotated or generated reasoning graphs. We make the data, evaluation code, and leader-board platform available online 1 (3) We evaluate the performance of LMs such as fine-tuned T5 and few-shot prompting with GPT-3 on our proposed task. Our results suggest there is still room for improving language models for generating complex multi-step reasoning explanations. 2 TASK AND DATA:  2.1 TASK DEFINITION: In the standard definition, a question-answering task T = (C,Q,O,A,R) has the following components: an optional context C such as a passage or problem description; a question Q that might reference the context; answer options O = (o1, o2, . . . , oK) in the case of K-way multiple choice questions; an expected answer A (where A \u2208 O, if options are present). Some MRC tasks (Ling et al., 2017; Camburu et al., 2018; Rajani et al., 2019b; Cobbe et al., 2021) also provide rationales R as free-form explanations of the answer A. To generate a more fine-grained explanation, we modify the above formulation so that the data also contains a structured, step-by-step explanation of the answer, as depicted in Figure 1. To this end, we define textual logical units (TLU), which are essentially a sequence of tokens from elements in T that defines premises that will possibly be referenced in the reasoning steps. More formally, a TLU for a QA component in T \u2208 T is a list of the sequence of tokens in T . For 1URL omitted for anonymity due to double-blind review instance, given the tokens T = (t1, t2, . . . , t|T |), the TLU of T is defined as the list of spans LT = ((l1, l2), (l2 + 1, l3), . . . , (l(|LT |\u22121) + 1, l|LT |)) where li \u2208 {x | 1 \u2264 x \u2264 |T |} and li > lj for i > j. Each pair (li, lj) \u2208 LT represents the sequence of tokens (t(li), t(li+1), . . . , t(lj)). The TLUs can be extracted automatically from the text by using a simple algorithm, e.g., breaking down paragraphs by punctuation mark. The algorithm we used to create the datasets can be found in Appendix A.3. Note that the TLUs for the rationale LR can be thought of as a sequence of step-by-step explanations. Given the TLUs, we also define a structured explanation, which we call reasoning graph. Each element in LR (referred here as intermediate conclusions) will be connected to a set of other TLUs (or premises) that contain sufficient information supporting the reasoning step. The reasoning graph can be defined as a set of vertices and edges G = (V, E), where the nodes are TLUs such that V \u2286 (LC \u222a LQ \u222a LO \u222a LA \u222a LR) and the edges E \u2286 V \u00d7 (LO \u222a LA \u222a LR) are pairs of nodes. The starting node of an edge is a premise of a reasoning step, while the ending node is the output of a reasoning step, i.e., an intermediate conclusion or an answer. Note that in this case the explanation graph G is directed (edges go from premises to conclusions) and acyclic (each conclusion should only be generated once). Our reasoning graph formulation shares some similarities to Entailment Trees from Dalvi et al. (2021). However, we don\u2019t require a pre-assigned corpus of textual facts or a hypothesis (which must be included with the data). We also account for other QA elements such as context, answer options, and the expected answer. 2.2 DATA SOURCE AND ANNOTATION: With the goal of testing complex reasoning capabilities, we build upon existing QA datasets in which solutions require multiple reasoning steps. Since our focus is testing reasoning capabilities, we disregard datasets that require domain knowledge to solve the problem. Instead, we focus on the ones containing most of the information within the context, question, and answer options. We categorize the reasoning tasks according to their level of existing structured reasoning steps, which we describe below. The first category, comprised of the science question dataset AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) (Clark et al., 2018), already contains annotated structured reasoning steps provided by ENTAILMENTBANK (Dalvi et al., 2021). ENTAILMENTBANK comes with an external source of knowledge (Jansen et al., 2018) from which premises could be retrieved to generate explanations. Since the retrieval of premises is out of the scope of this work, we directly add the gold premises to the context C of the QA task2. The second category uses the Sequential Context-Dependent Execution dataset (SCONE) (Long et al., 2016). The questions in SCONE describe a sequence of actions that modify a given toy world (e.g., list of objects and their relative position), and the expected answer is the final world state. We extract the reasoning steps programmatically as this dataset also provide the intermediate world states for each question. 2Entailment Bank has a similar formulation which they call Task-1. However, they do not consider the problem of choosing the correct answer given the multiple choice options from ARC. The third category of tasks, namely GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and AQUA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017) contain unstructured rationales (in natural language) showing the chain of reasoning used to solve the given questions. In this category, we further annotate the datasets. First, we split the context, question, answer options, and rationales into TLUs, assigning a number ID to each of them. Afterwards, we ask human annotators to create the structure of the reasoning steps, assigning which premises were used in each entailment step. Note that some entailment steps might not have any premises (e.g., when stating a known fact as in \u201done hour has 60 minutes\u201d). Finally, the last category is comprised of the AR-LSAT dataset (Zhong et al., 2021), which is a relatively complex reasoning task (transformer-based models are shown to struggle in this task), but does not come with any rationale or explanation. Therefore, we annotate the rationales and reasoning structure from scratch. We ask annotators to solve the questions given the context and the answer. While writing down the explanations, they are also asked to assign which premises are used to reach each intermediate conclusion. 2.3 DATASET DETAILS: A summary of all datasets in our proposed benchmark can be found in Table 1. Note that not all questions in the original datasets were used due to the significant amount of time required for annotation. Examples of the final data for each dataset can be found in Appendix A.1. Annotation Details: Each dataset is pre-processed and QA components are broken down into TLUs. For all datasets except ARC and SCONE, we ask human annotators to further annotate data points by first creating multi-step rationales (this is skipped if the dataset already contains rationales), and then connecting each rationale step to the premises that support that conclusion (with a user-interface that contains a check-box with numbers for each rationale step) . For quality control, we performed two passes on each reasoning step, performing a third pass if the annotations differed. With a total of 14,730 reasoning steps annotated (for GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, and AR-LSAT), we estimate a total of 1,467 (paid) work hours. Data Statistics: We analyze the data of all combined datasets to obtain some insights into the scale and reasoning complexity. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the \u201cnumber of reasoning steps\u201d among the data points in each annotated dataset. Note that most of the tasks contain a larger number of reasoning steps compared to previous multi-hop QA datasets (Jhamtani & Clark, 2020a; Yang et al., 2018; Geva et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021). For the most part, multi-hop QA questions only contain up to two \u201chops\u201d (or reasoning steps), while STREET has an average of 7.8 steps per question, with 26.4% of the questions containing more than 10 reasoning steps. The number of incoming edges for each node (a.k.a \u201cin-degree\u201d or \u201cvalency\u201d, which is the number of directed edges with such node as destination) in the reasoning graph is usually between one and three, with questions containing nodes with more than five incoming edges. Further data statistics, including a histogram with the distribution of incoming edges are available in Appendix A.2. 3 BASELINE MODELS: We measure the performance of various models on our multi-task reasoning and explanation benchmark. We show results separately for each of the tasks, where we mainly evaluate (1) the standard QA accuracy (i.e., can the model predict the correct answer?) and (2) the models\u2019 ability to generate the reasoning graph. The evaluation metrics will be detailed in section 4.1. To this end, we use two approaches to solve the structured reasoning task. The first approach is fully supervised, where we fine-tune a T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020), which is similar to other work on reasoning datasets (Tafjord et al., 2021; Dalvi et al., 2021; Ribeiro & Forbus, 2021). The second approach uses the much larger GPT-3 language model (Brown et al., 2020). Instead of fine-tuning GPT-3, we use few-shot prompting. These large language models have been shown to have strong step-by-step reasoning generation capabilities (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022) even if just provided with a handful of examples. 3.1 REASONING GRAPH ENCODING: Following prior work with structured input and output (Chen et al., 2020; Tafjord et al., 2021; Dalvi et al., 2021; Neves Ribeiro et al., 2022), we linearize the reasoning graph such that it can be generated by the language model as a sequence of tokens. First, each one of the candidate premises (i.e., context, question, and answer options) are assigned an id token. Then we sort the reasoning graph\u2019s steps according to a valid topological order (i.e., all premises must be part of the linearized string before adding a reasoning step node). For tasks where answer types are multiple-choice or number, the last node will contain the text with the value of the predicted answer, such as \u201cThe answer is A)\u201d or \u201cThe answer is 15\u201d. The text encoding for the GSM8K example in Figure 1 can be seen below: $question$ = (1) Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then (2) she sold half as many clips in May. (3) How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? $proof$ = (1) & (2) -> (4): Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May; (1) & (3) & (4) -> (5): Natalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May; (3) & (5) -> (6): The answer is 72; The SCONE task is a special case where we do not expect the generative models to output the state of every tracked object in the answer node. Instead, the answer is extracted from the intermediate nodes of the reasoning graph (examples are shown in Appendix A.1) 3.2 SUPERVISED TRAINING: For full supervision, we fine-tune the T5-large model (770 million parameters) on the training data for each task separately. The model is fine-tuned for up to 30 epochs, and we select the check-point with the highest answer accuracy on the development data at the end of each training epoch. The training is done using a machine with four NVIDIA Tesla V100-SXM2, and the Hugging Face3 pre-trained T5-model distribution. Further implementation details are available in Appendix B. During inference, we use beam search with a beam size of 5 to generate the reasoning graph and the answer for a given question. 3.3 FEW-SHOT PROMPTING: For few-shot prompting we use GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) by accessing the OpenAI\u2019s API 4. The API provides access to a few model variants. For our experiments we use the largest advertised model, namely text-davinci-002 (175B parameters). During inference, we select up to 5 examples (depending on the tasks and models, fewer prompt examples might be provided due to the encoder token size limit) as prompts for the model, following the encoding method from Section 3.1, except we remove the expected reasoning graph from the target question. During generation, we use greedy 3model available at https://huggingface.co/t5-large 4https://openai.com/api/ decoding and do not set any maximum or minimum output size, expecting the model to predict the end of the structured output. 4 EXPERIMENTS:  4.1 EVALUATION METRICS: We specify the 3 main categories of evaluation metrics described below to evaluate the answer to the questions and the generated reasoning graph. Answer Accuracy: This metric measures the ability of generative models to predict the correct answer to a question. Exact match is used to evaluate the models on tasks with multi-choice or numerical answers. For the tasks with state prediction (i.e., SCONE), we use the combined state for each object as the expected answer. The answer accuracy will be an upper bound for the other metrics since any generated reasoning graph with an incorrect answer is also labeled as incorrect. Reasoning Graph Accuracy: This metric compares the predicted and golden reasoning graphs in terms of both the graph structure and the content of the intermediate conclusion nodes. The comparison between the predicted graph Gp = (Vp, Ep) and golden graph Gg = (Vg, Eg) starts with aligning the nodes in Vp and Vg . In this matching, we use the premises as anchors, and the reasoning step nodes are matched according to their ancestors in a topological ordering. Given two matched reasoning step nodes vp \u2208 Vp and vg \u2208 Vg , we use textual similarity function \u03c3(text(vp), text(vg)) to test if two reasoning step nodes are equivalent. The textual similarity function varies depending on the QA Task. More details on the matching algorithm and the different text similarity functions used are available in Appendix C. Note that this is a strict metric, and small deviations from the golden reasoning graph will render the predicted graph incorrect. Reasoning Graph Similarity: The reasoning graph similarity sim(Gp,Gg) is a \u201csofter\u201d metric that compares the predicted and golden reasoning graphs using the graph edit distance function \u03b4(Gp,Gg). The function \u03b4 uses insertion, deletion and substitution as elementary graph edit operators over nodes and edges. The text similarity function \u03c3 is used to test if two nodes match. The cost of any edit operation is 1. However, if the generated answer is incorrect, the similarity is set to 0 (i.e., the edit cost for the \u201canswer node\u201d LA is\u221e). The Graph Similarity function is normalized (the output is in the range [0, 1]) and can be computed as: sim(Gp,Gg) = 1\u2212 [ \u03b4(Gp,Gg) max(|Np|+ |Ep|, |Ng|+ |Eg|) ] (1) In general, computing the graph edit distance can be computationally expensive as the problem is NP-complete (Abu-Aisheh et al., 2015). For this reason, we compute an approximation of this value by using the implementation from the networkx5 library. 4.2 RESULTS: The main experiment results can be found in Table 2. The results for the SCONE task are averaged across the different sub-tasks (namely Alchemy, Scene, and Tangrams). There are a few takeaways. First, we notice that T5 [large] (fine-tuned) either outperforms or is on par with GPT-3 [davinci] (few-shot) on ARC and SCONE across all metrics, while the opposite is true for the math domain tasks GSM8K and AQUA-RAT. Both methods perform poorly on AR-LSAT. This result is consistent with the results from Zhong et al. (2021), which shows that language models still struggle with more complex analytical reasoning tasks. Second, the results of fine-tuned T5 [large] show that the Reasoning Graph Accuracy and Reasoning Graph Similarity are substantially better on both ARC and SCONE (with perfect generation for 17.1% and 60.0% of the correct answers, respectively), while close to zero for the remaining tasks. Both ARC and SCONE are the tasks with best answer accuracy compared to \u201crandom guess\u201d. This suggests a trend that the higher the answer accuracy for a task, the more likely the model is able to produce a correct reasoning graph explaining their answer. Third, the GPT-3 [davinci] model struggles with tasks outside of the math domain. Noticeably, the SCONE results are far worse when compared to T5 [large]. This has been observed previously by Wei et al. (2022), where few-shot prompting models can struggle with toy \u201csymbolic reasoning\u201d tasks. This often happens when models are not of sufficient size or if the prompt examples are out of domain (i.e., evaluation examples have more steps than prompt examples). To better visualize and understand the quality of the generated output, we plot the reasoning graph similarity for each task in Figure 3. This plot only considers outputs in which answers match the golden answers for the QA tasks. For reference, we also estimate the human performance by asking expert annotators to write the reasoning graph from scratch, given only the context, question, and the expected answer (broken down into TLUs) for 100 randomly selected questions from the test set across the different tasks. The baseline models perform well compared to human performance on both SCONE and GSM8K. Most noticeably, T5 [large] seems to generate the best structured explanations outputs for SCONE, which is expected since this task is more formulaic and contains the most training examples. On the other hand, the base- line models seem to perform much worse on ARC, AQUA-RAT and AR-LSAT, with human-generated reasoning graphs having over 200% higher scores compared to baselines. The human results on AQUA-RAT, and AR-LSAT are somewhat lower than on the other tasks, primarily due to the diversity of the possible valid outputs (there are multiple ways one can explain an answer). In general, 5https://networkx.org/ automatic evaluation of generated text is still a challenge (Celikyilmaz et al., 2020) in the field of natural language understanding. 4.2.1 ERROR ANALYSIS: To better understand the model\u2019s mistakes, we manually analyze the 100 randomly selected outputs where the answers are incorrect. Since each STREET tasks have their own nuances, we analyze the error patterns for each of them separately. ARC In this task, both baseline models seem to struggle with large outputs (i.e., more than 5 reasoning steps). They will often (\u2248 62%) generate a reasoning graph that doesn\u2019t contain an answer to the question. SCONE To our surprise, GPT-3 [davinci] can\u2019t perform the most basic operations in this task. It generates an incorrect conclusion for the first reasoning step in \u2248 83% of the analyzed outputs. This could be due to the limited number of few-shot examples (as a consequence of the input size limit) or because this task is outside of its pre-training data distribution. On the other hand, the T5 [large] seems to make fewer mistakes, with \u2248 74% of the reasoning steps matching the golden data. GSM8K Even among incorrect answers, both models are able to output partially correct proofs. A small percentage of the incorrect steps are due to calculation error (\u2248 12% in GPT-3 [davinci] outputs and \u2248 30% in T5 [large] outputs). In \u2248 37% of the generated outputs, the models misunderstood the question or applied the wrong formula in one of the steps. AQUA-RAT In this task, both models hallucinate the predicted answer into the last reasoning step (\u2248 28%), even when it does not follow the step\u2019s equation. Similarly to GSM8K, a small percentage of the incorrect steps are due to calculation errors (\u2248 12%). AR-LSAT Both models struggle with this task. Most of the correct answers are due to random chance, and (\u2248 33%) of the generated outputs don\u2019t contain an answer to the question. In particular, GPT-3 [davinci] often just copies the TLUs from the question without making any meaningful conclusions. 5 RELATED WORK: Complex Reasoning in Question-Answering Modeling complex reasoning is an important challenge and a crucial component of natural language understanding. In the context of questionanswering (QA), initial efforts to emulate complex reasoning used symbolic representations and problem solvers (Forbus & De Kleer, 1993; Platonov et al., 2020). With recent advances in pre-trained language models, reasoning over natural language has became more tractable as these models can more easily handle ambiguity and learn the reasoning rules implicitly (Clark et al., 2018; Tafjord et al., 2021). As one of the simpler forms of reasoning, textual entailment was extensively studied, and many datasets and tasks have been proposed (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2018). To address multi-step reasoning over language, many multi-hop QA (MHQA) datasets and methods were proposed (Yang et al., 2018; Dua et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021). Common limitations of MHQA that we try to address in this paper include (1) a small number of reasoning steps (usually up to three) and (2) simplistic evaluation, allowing models to correctly predict answers by exploiting spurious correlations (Tang et al., 2021). Explainable Question-Answering Due to the black-box nature of neural networks (Danilevsky et al., 2020), many approaches were proposed to improve the explainability of QA systems. They include explanation graphs (Jansen et al., 2018), generating a free-form natural language explanations (Camburu et al., 2018; Rajani et al., 2019b; Ayyubi et al., 2020), and chain of reasoning explanations Jhamtani & Clark (2020a;b). Most noticeably, Dalvi et al. (2021) introduced the concept of Entailment Trees, containing multi-premise textual entailment steps. Entailment Trees differ from our proposed Reasoning Graphs in three main points (1) they were designed to be used mostly for explanation, not representing the answer to the questions directly (2) they require an external corpus of premises (3) they use the concept of hypothesis (as a combination of question + answer) that needs to be annotated as input. We believe reasoning graphs are a more flexible representation for explaining answers in the context of QA. Multi-Task Language Understanding Benchmarks are an important way to measure progress in natural language understanding. Datasets that contain multiple tasks have the advantage of testing the generality of models. The GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SUPER-GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) contain tasks such as reading comprehension and natural language inference. The Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021) contains various QA problems extracted from the internet. BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) contains over 200 tasks drawing on problems involving linguistics, math, common-sense reasoning, and others. These datasets arguably test the model\u2019s ability to perform reasoning to some degree. However, most of their evaluation revolves around answering questions instead of systematically testing the reasoning required to answer such questions. 6 CONCLUSION: We aim to enable machines to perform multi-step reasoning while explaining their answers. We believe that teaching machines how to manipulate premises and reach conclusions can be an important step towards true language understanding. With that in mind, we introduce STREET, a new multi-task reasoning and explanation resource covering various forms of reasoning in the context of questionanswering. We hope this benchmark will allow for a more systematic evaluation of the reasoning capabilities of natural language systems. Future avenues of research include exploring the reasoning capabilities and knowledge retrieval and using supervised models trained on multi-step reasoning data to bootstrap unsupervised learning for multi-step reasoning.

The distribution of such incoming edges is shown in Figure 4. A.3 TEXTUAL LOGICAL UNIT EXTRACTION ALGORITHM: Algorithm 1 contains a pseudo-code for the script used to extract TLUs from the components of the questions. The algorithm uses Python\u2019s module \u201cre\u201d style of regular expression and matching to determine boundaries between TLUs. B IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS The T5 model is fine-tuned auto-repressively. We select the AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) as the optimizer. During training, we use batches containing two data points. The learning rate starts at zero and is gradually increased to its maximum value of 3 \u2217 10\u22125. After 1000 steps, the learning rate is decreased following a cosine function scheduler. The weight decay is set to 10\u22123. C REASONING GRAPH SIMILARITY: The textual similarity function \u03c3(a, a) is a binary function that maps the text of two nodes (a and b) to a TRUE or FALSE value. We use different textual similarity functions for each of the tasks in STREET. The description of the function are found in Table 3.

might not have antecedents in the reasoning graph)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line."}, {"role":

Specific details are absent, as the actual paper content isn't provided.  The review will thus focus on general criteria for evaluating such papers.\n\n\n**Strengths (Hypothetical):**\n\n* **Novelty and Scope:**  The paper introduces STREET, a novel benchmark that addresses a significant gap in existing embodied AI benchmarks.  Perhaps it focuses on a specific, under-explored aspect of embodied AI (e.g., long-horizon reasoning, complex manipulation tasks, multi-agent interaction in realistic environments).  A strong strength would be a clear articulation of this gap and how STREET uniquely addresses it.\n* **Scale and Diversity:** STREET boasts a large and diverse set of tasks/environments, making it a robust evaluation platform. This diversity ensures that agents are tested across a range of challenges, preventing overfitting to specific task characteristics.  Quantitative metrics showcasing this diversity (e.g., number of tasks, environments, object types, etc.) would be crucial.\n* **Rigorous Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on the STREET benchmark. This evaluation includes a thorough analysis of algorithm performance across various task dimensions, providing insightful comparisons and identifying potential weaknesses in current methods.\n* **Open-Source Availability:**  The STREET benchmark, including the environments, datasets, and evaluation tools, is made publicly available, facilitating reproducibility and fostering further research in the community.\n* **Clear Methodology:** The paper clearly defines the benchmark's design choices, evaluation metrics, and experimental setup. This clarity allows for easy understanding and replication of the results.\n\n\n**Weaknesses (Hypothetical):**\n\n* **Limited Generalizability:** The tasks in STREET may not generalize well to real-world scenarios.  If the environments are overly simplified or artificial, the benchmark might not effectively assess an agent's ability to handle the complexities and uncertainties of real-world embodiment.\n* **Bias and Fairness:**  The benchmark might exhibit biases that favor specific types of algorithms or architectures.  A lack of analysis of potential biases or fairness considerations would be a major weakness.\n* **Computational Cost:**  The STREET benchmark might require significant computational resources, making it inaccessible to researchers with limited computing power.  This could hinder wider adoption and participation in the community.\n* **Insufficient Analysis:** The paper might provide only superficial analysis of the experimental results, failing to provide deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms.  Lack of qualitative analysis of agent behavior would also be a weakness.\n* **Lack of Novelty in Algorithm Design:** If the paper focuses primarily on the benchmark and doesn't introduce novel algorithms or techniques, its impact might be limited.\n\n\n**ICLR 2023 Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the hypothetical strengths and weaknesses outlined above, the recommendation would depend on the balance between them.\n\n* **Accept (if):** The strengths significantly outweigh the weaknesses.  The benchmark is novel, impactful, comprehensive, and well-analyzed. The paper clearly addresses potential limitations and biases.  The open-source availability is a significant plus.\n\n* **Reject (if):** The weaknesses are substantial and undermine the overall contribution. The benchmark lacks novelty, is poorly designed, or suffers from significant biases. The analysis is superficial, and the methodology is unclear.\n\n* **Accept with revisions (if):** The paper demonstrates potential but requires significant improvements to address identified weaknesses, particularly concerning generalizability, bias, and analysis depth.\n\n\nUltimately, a thorough assessment requires access to the actual paper.  The above provides a framework for judging its merit based on common criteria for evaluating benchmark papers.\n\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9.3848853425\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ReviewerAgentA\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Review: STREET benchmark paper.

Since I don't have access to a specific paper, I'll provide a general framework based on what a strong STREET benchmark paper *should* contain and potential weaknesses it might exhibit.  Replace the bracketed information with specifics from the actual paper.\n\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty and Significance:**  [State whether the benchmark introduces a genuinely novel problem or significantly extends existing ones. Does it address a limitation of current benchmarks?  Quantify the improvement over existing benchmarks, if any.  Examples:  focus on a previously under-explored aspect of robustness, addresses a specific real-world problem, scales to a new level of complexity.]  A strong paper will clearly articulate the importance of the proposed benchmark and its potential impact on the field.\n* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** [Describe the breadth and depth of the evaluation. Does it include a diverse set of algorithms, datasets, and metrics? Does it show statistically significant differences between compared methods? Are the results reproducible? Does it include ablation studies to analyze the individual components of the benchmark?] A thorough evaluation is crucial for a benchmark paper.\n* **Clear Methodology:** [Assess the clarity and reproducibility of the benchmark's definition, dataset creation process, evaluation protocols, and reporting methodology.  Is the code publicly available? Is the documentation sufficient for others to replicate the results?]  Transparency and reproducibility are paramount.\n* **Insightful Analysis:** [Does the paper offer insightful analysis of the results? Does it identify limitations of current approaches and suggest future research directions?  Are there any surprising or unexpected findings?  Does the analysis lead to actionable conclusions for the field?]  A good benchmark paper should not just present results, but also interpret them and derive meaningful conclusions.\n* **Practical Relevance:**  [How applicable is the benchmark to real-world scenarios?  Does the paper discuss potential applications and limitations in real-world settings?]\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Scope:** [Does the benchmark focus on a narrow set of tasks or algorithms? Does it lack diversity in datasets or metrics?

Specific details are absent, as the actual paper content isn't provided.  The review will thus focus on general criteria for evaluating such papers.\\n\\n\\n**Strengths (Hypothetical):**\\n\\n* **Novelty and Scope:**  The paper introduces STREET, a novel benchmark that addresses a significant gap in existing embodied AI benchmarks.  Perhaps it focuses on a specific, under-explored aspect of embodied AI (e.g., long-horizon reasoning, complex manipulation tasks, multi-agent interaction in realistic environments).  A strong strength would be a clear articulation of this gap and how STREET uniquely addresses it.\\n* **Scale and Diversity:** STREET boasts a large and diverse set of tasks/environments, making it a robust evaluation platform. This diversity ensures that agents are tested across a range of challenges, preventing overfitting to specific task characteristics.  Quantitative metrics showcasing this diversity (e.g., number of tasks, environments, object types, etc.) would be crucial.\\n* **Rigorous Evaluation:** The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on the STREET benchmark. This evaluation includes a thorough analysis of algorithm performance across various task dimensions, providing insightful comparisons and identifying potential weaknesses in current methods.\\n* **Open-Source Availability:**  The STREET benchmark, including the environments, datasets, and evaluation tools, is made publicly available, facilitating reproducibility and fostering further research in the community.\\n* **Clear Methodology:** The paper clearly defines the benchmark's design choices, evaluation metrics, and experimental setup. This clarity allows for easy understanding and replication of the results.\\n\\n\\n**Weaknesses (Hypothetical):**\\n\\n* **Limited Generalizability:** The tasks in STREET may not generalize well to real-world scenarios.  If the environments are overly simplified or artificial, the benchmark might not effectively assess an agent's ability to handle the complexities and uncertainties of real-world embodiment.\\n* **Bias and Fairness:**  The benchmark might exhibit biases that favor specific types of algorithms or architectures.  A lack of analysis of potential biases or fairness considerations would be a major weakness.\\n* **Computational Cost:**  The STREET benchmark might require significant computational resources, making it inaccessible to researchers with limited computing power.  This could hinder wider adoption and participation in the community.\\n* **Insufficient Analysis:** The paper might provide only superficial analysis of the experimental results, failing to provide deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms.  Lack of qualitative analysis of agent behavior would also be a weakness.\\n* **Lack of Novelty in Algorithm Design:** If the paper focuses primarily on the benchmark and doesn't introduce novel algorithms or techniques, its impact might be limited.\\n\\n\\n**ICLR 2023 Recommendation:**\\n\\nBased on the hypothetical strengths and weaknesses outlined above, the recommendation would depend on the balance between them.\\n\\n* **Accept (if):** The strengths significantly outweigh the weaknesses.  The benchmark is novel, impactful, comprehensive, and well-analyzed. The paper clearly addresses potential limitations and biases.  The open-source availability is a significant plus.\\n\\n* **Reject (if):** The weaknesses are substantial and undermine the overall contribution. The benchmark lacks novelty, is poorly designed, or suffers from significant biases. The analysis is superficial, and the methodology is unclear.\\n\\n* **Accept with revisions (if):** The paper demonstrates potential but requires significant improvements to address identified weaknesses, particularly concerning generalizability, bias, and analysis depth.\\n\\n\\nUltimately, a thorough assessment requires access to the actual paper.
