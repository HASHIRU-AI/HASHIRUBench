The paper title is: Towards a More Rigorous Science of Blindspot Discovery in Image Models\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: A growing body of work has found that models with high test performance can still make systemic errors, which occur when the model performs significantly worse on a semantically meaningful subset of the data (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Chung et al., 2019; Oakden-Rayner et al., 2020; Singla et al., 2021; Ribeiro & Lundberg, 2022). For example, past works have demonstrated that models trained to diagnose skin cancer from dermoscopic images sometimes rely on spurious artifacts (e.g., surgical skin markers that some dermatologists use to mark lesions); consequently, they have different performance on images with or without those spurious artifacts (Winkler et al., 2019; Mahmood et al., 2021). More broadly, finding systemic errors can help us detect algorithmic bias (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) or sensitivity to distribution shifts (Sagawa et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020). In this work, we focus on what we call the blindspot discovery problem, which is the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors1 without making many of the assumptions considered in related works (e.g., we do not assume access to metadata to define semantically meaningful subsets of the data, tools to produce counterfactual images, a specific model structure or training process, or a human in the loop). We call methods for addressing this problem Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) (e.g., Kim et al., 2019; Sohoni et al., 2020; Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). We note that blindspot discovery is an emerging research area and that there has been more emphasis on developing BDMs than on formalizing the problem itself. Consequently, we propose a problem formalization, summarize different approaches for evaluating BDMs, and summarize several highlevel design choices made by BDMs. When we do this, we observe the following two gaps. First, existing evaluations are based on an incomplete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots, which limits the types of measurements and claims they can make. Second, dimensionality reduction is a relatively underexplored aspect of BDM design. Motivated by these gaps in prior work, we propose a new evaluation framework, SpotCheck, and a new BDM, PlaneSpot. SpotCheck is a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM 1In past work, \u201csystemic errors\u201d have also been called \u201cfailure modes\u201d or \u201chidden stratification.\u201d We introduce \u201cblindspot\u201d to mean the same thing and use it make it clear when we are specifically discussing blindspot discovery. performance. Additionally, we refine the metrics used by past evaluations. PlaneSpot is a simple BDM that finds blindspots using a 2D image representation. We use SpotCheck to run controlled experiments that identify factors that influence BDM performance (e.g., the number of blindspot in a model) and show that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs. We run additional semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) and find that these trends discovered using SpotCheck generalize to real image data. Overall, we hope that the methodology and analyses presented in this work will help facilitate a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. 2 BACKGROUND: In this section, we formalize the problem of blindspot discovery for image classification. We then discuss general approaches for evaluating the Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) designed to address this problem as well as high-level design choices made by BDMs. Problem Definition. The broad goal of finding systematic errors has been studied across a range of problem statements and method assumptions. Some common assumptions are: \u2022 Access to metadata help define coherent subsets of the data (e.g., Kim et al., 2018; Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Singh et al., 2020). \u2022 The ability to produce counterfactual images (e.g., Shetty et al., 2019; Singla et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021; Leclerc et al., 2021; Bharadhwaj et al., 2021; Plumb et al., 2022). \u2022 A specific structure for the model we are analyzing (e.g., Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018; Koh et al., 2020) or for training process used to learn the model\u2019s parameters (e.g., Wong et al., 2021). \u2022 A human-in-the loop, either through an interactive interface (e.g., Cabrera et al., 2019; Balayn et al., 2022) or by inspecting explanations (e.g., Yeh et al., 2020; Adebayo et al., 2022). While appropriate at times, these assumptions all restrict the applicability of their respective methods. For example, consider assuming access to metadata to help define coherent subsets of the data. To start, this metadata is much less common in applied settings than it is for common ML benchmarks. Further, the efficacy of methods that rely on this metadata is limited by the quantity and relevance of this metadata; in general, efficiently collecting large quantities of relevant metadata is challenging because it requires anticipating the model\u2019s systemic errors. Consequently, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors without making any of these assumptions. More formally, suppose that we have an image classifier, f , and a dataset of labeled images, D = [xi]ni=1. Then, a blindspot is a coherent (i.e., semantically meaningful) set of images, \u21e2 D, where f performs significantly worse (i.e., p(f, ) \u2327 p(f,D \\ ) for some performance metric, p, such as recall). We denote the set of f \u2019s true blindspots as : { m}Mm=1. Next, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding using only f and D. Then, a BDM is a method that takes as input f and D and outputs an ordered (by some definition of importance) list of hypothesized blindspots,  \u0302 : [ \u0302k]Kk=1. Note that the m and  \u0302k are sets of images. Approaches to BDM evaluation. We observe that existing approaches to quantitatively evaluate BDMs fall in two categories. The first category of evaluations simply measure the error rate or size of  \u0302k (Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021). However, these evaluations have two problems. First, none of the properties they measure capture whether  \u0302k is coherent (e.g., a random sample of misclassified images has high error but may not match a single semantically meaningful description). Second, f \u2019s performance on  \u0302k may not be representative of f \u2019s performance on similar images because BDMs are optimized to return high error images (e.g., suppose that f has a 90% accuracy on images of \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d; then, by returning the 10% of such images that are misclassified, a BDM could mislead us into believing that f has a 0% accuracy on this type of image). The second category of evaluations compares  \u0302 to a subset of that have either been artificially induced or previously found (Sohoni et al., 2020; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). While these evaluations address the issues with those from the first category, they require knowledge of , which is usually incomplete (i.e., we usually only know a subset of ). This incompleteness makes it difficult to identify factors that influence BDM performance or to measure a BDM\u2019s recall or false positive rate. It is fundamentally impossible to fix this incompleteness using real data because we cannot enumerate all of the possible coherent subsets of D to check if they are blindspots. To address these limitations, we introduce SpotCheck, which gives us complete knowledge of by using synthetic data. High-level design choices of BDMs. In Table 1, we summarize three of the high-level design choices made by existing BDMs. First, each BDM uses a model to extract an image representation. Many BDMs use a representation from f , but some use pre-trained external models or other models trained on D. Second, some of the BDMs apply some form of dimensionality reduction to that image representation. Third, each BDM learns a model from a specified hypothesis class to predict if an image belongs to a blindspot from that image\u2019s (potentially reduced) representation. Interestingly, while there has been significant effort focused on the choice of a BDM\u2019s image representation and hypothesis class (along with its associated learning algorithm), we note that dimensionality reduction has received much less attention. This is surprising because these BDMs are all solving clustering or learning problems, which are generally easier in lower dimensions. Motivated by this gap in prior work, we introduce a simple BDM, PlaneSpot, that uses a 2D representation. 3 EVALUATING BDMS USING KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: In Section 3.1, we introduce SpotCheck, which is an evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots by using synthetic images and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM performance. In Section 3.2, we define the metrics that we use to measure the performance of BDMs given knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. 3.1 SPOTCHECK : A SYNTHETIC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR BDMS SpotCheck builds on ideas from Kim et al. (2022) by generating synthetic datasets of varying complexity and training models to have specific blindspots on those datasets. We summarize its key steps below; see Appendix A for details. Dataset Definition. Each dataset is defined using semantic features that describe the possible types of images it contains. Datasets that have a larger number of features have a larger variety of images and are therefore more complex. For example, a simple dataset may only contain images with squares and blue or orange circles (see Figure 1), while a more complicated dataset may also contain images with striped rectangles, small text, or grey backgrounds. Blindspot Definition. Each blindspot is defined using a subset of the semantic features that define its associated dataset (see Figure 1). Similarly to how a dataset with more features is more complex, a blindspot defined using more semantic features is more specific. Training a Model to have Specific Blindspots. For each dataset and blindspot specification, we train a ResNet-18 model (He et al., 2016) to predict whether a square is present. To induce blindspots, we generate data where the label for each image in the training and validation sets is correct if and only if it does not belong to any of the blindspots (see Figure 1). The test set images are always correctly labeled. Then, because we know the full set of semantic features that define the dataset, we can verify that the model learned to have exactly the set of blindspots that we intended it to. As a result, SpotCheck gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. Generating Diverse Experimental Configurations (ECs). Since our goal is to study how various factors influence BDM performance, we generate a diverse set of experimental configurations, (i.e., dataset, blindspots, and model triplets). To do this, we randomize several factors: the features that define a dataset (both the number of them and what they are) as well as the blindspots (the number of them, the number of features that define them, and what those features are). Importantly, we sample these factors independently of one another across this set of ECs so that we can estimate their individual influence on BDM performance. 3.2 EVALUATION METRICS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: These metrics measure how well the hypothesized blindspots returned by a BDM,  \u0302, capture a model\u2019s true blindspots, . Recall that the  \u0302k and m are sets of images. To do this, we start by measuring how well a BDM finds each individual true blindspot (Blindspot Recall) and build on that to measure how well a BDM finds the complete set of true blindspots (Discovery Rate and False Discovery Rate); see Appendix B for a discussion of how these metrics refine prior definitions. Blindspot Precision. If  \u0302k is a subset of m, we know that the model underperforms on  \u0302k and that  \u0302k is coherent. We measure this using the precision of  \u0302k with respect to m: BP( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\ m| | \u0302k| (1) Then, we say that  \u0302k belongs to m if, for some threshold p: BP( \u0302k, m) p (2) However,  \u0302k can belong to m without capturing the same information as m. For example,  \u0302k could be \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d while m could be \u201csquares and blue or orange circles\u201d. Because this excessive specificity could result in the user arriving at conclusions that are too narrow, we need to incorporate some notion of recall into the evaluation. Blindspot Recall. One way to incorporate recall is using the proportion of m that  \u0302k covers: BRnaive( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\ m| | m| (3) We relax this definition by allowing m to be covered by the union of the  \u0302k that belong to it: BR( \u0302, m) = S  \u0302k:BP( \u0302k, m) p  \u0302k ! \\ m | m| (4) Then, we say that  \u0302 covers m if, for some threshold r: BR( \u0302, m) r (5) We do this because \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d and \u201csquares and orange circles\u201d belong to and jointly cover \u201csquares and blue or orange circles.\u201d So, if a BDM returns both, a user could combine them to arrive at the correct conclusion. Discovery Rate (DR). We define the DR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the m that  \u0302 covers: DR( \u0302, ) = 1 M X m (BR( \u0302, m) r) (6) False Discovery Rate (FDR). When the DR is non-zero, we define FDR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the  \u0302k that do not belong to any of the :2 FDR( \u0302, ) = 1 K X k (max m BP ( \u0302k, m) < p) (7) Note that it is impossible to calculate the FDR without the complete set of true blindspots. While SpotCheck gives us this knowledge, it is generally not available. 4 PLANESPOT : A SIMPLE BDM BASED ON DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION In this section, we define PlaneSpot. As shown in Table 1, PlaneSpot uses the most common choices for the image representation (i.e., f \u2019s own representation) and the hypothesis class (i.e., gaussian kernels). PlaneSpot also uses standard techniques to learn a model from that hypothesis class. As a result, the most interesting aspect of PlaneSpot\u2019s design is that it finds blindspots using a 2D representation. We start by defining some additional notation and then explain PlaneSpot\u2019s choice for each of the high-level design choices made by a BDM. Notation. Suppose that we want to find f \u2019s blindspots for a class, c, and let Dc be the set of images from D that belong to c. Further, suppose that we have divided f into two parts: g : X ! Rd, which extracts f \u2019s representation of an image (i.e., its penultimate layer activations), and h : Rd ! [0, 1], which gives f \u2019s predicted confidence for c. Image Representation. We use g to extract f \u2019s representation for Dc, G = g(Dc) 2 Rn\u21e5d, and h to extract f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H = h(G) 2 [0, 1]n\u21e51. Note that, because all of the images in Dc belong to c, entries of H closer to 1 denote higher confidence in the true class. Dimensionality Reduction. We use G to train scvis (Ding et al., 2018), which combines the objective functions of tSNE and an autoencoder, in order to learn a 2D representation of f \u2019s representation, s : Rd ! R2. Then, we use s to get the 2D representation of Dc, S = s(G) 2 Rn\u21e52. Finally, we normalize the columns of S to be in [0, 1], S\u0304 2 [0, 1]n\u21e52. Hypothesis Class. We want PlaneSpot to be aware of both the representation of Dc, S\u0304, and f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H , so we combine them into a single representation, R = [S\u0304;w \u00b7H] 2 Rn\u21e53 where w is a hyperparameter controlling the relative weight of these components. Then, we pass R to a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm, where the number of clusters is chosen using the Bayesian Information Criteria. Finally, we return those clusters in order of decreasing importance, which we define using the product of their error rate and the number of errors in them. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In Section 5.1, we use SpotCheck to run a series of controlled experiments using synthetic data. In Section 5.2, we demonstrate how to setup semi-controlled experiments to validate that the findings from SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. 2While calculating DR, we may only need the top-u items of  \u0302. As a result, we only calculate the FDR over those top-u items. This prevents the FDR from being overly pessimistic when we intentionally pick K too large in our experiments. However, it is unclear what value of u to use for ECs that have a DR of zero, so we exclude these ECs from our FDR analysis. Table 2: Average BDM DR and FDR with their standard errors across 100 SpotCheck ECs. Method DR FDR Barlow 0.43 (0.04) 0.03 (0.01) Spotlight 0.79 (0.03) 0.09 (0.01) Domino 0.64 (0.04) 0.07 (0.01) PlaneSpot 0.88 (0.03) 0.02 (0.01) 5.1 SYNTHETIC DATA EXPERIMENTS: We use SpotCheck to generate 100 ECs whose datasets have 6-8 semantic features and whose models have 1-3 blindspots defined with 5-7 features. We evaluate three recent BDMs: Spotlight (d\u2019Eon et al., 2021), Barlow (Singla et al., 2021), Domino (Eyuboglu et al., 2022), and PlaneSpot. We give all BDMs the positive examples (i.e., images with squares) from the test set and limit them to returning 10 hypothesized blindspots. We use a held-out set of 20 ECs to tune each BDM\u2019s hyperparameters (see Appendix C). We use p = r = 0.8 for our metrics. Overall Results. Table 2 shows the DR and FDR results averaged across all 100 ECs. We observe that PlaneSpot has the highest DR and that PlaneSpot and Barlow have a lower FDR than Spotlight and Domino. In Appendix D, we take a deeper look at why these BDMs are failing and conclude that a significant portion of all of their failures can be explained by their tendency to merge multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot. Identifying factors that influence BDM performance. We study two types of factors: perconfiguration factors, which measure properties of the dataset (e.g., how complex is it?) or of the model (e.g., how many blindspots does it have?), and per-blindspot factors, which measure properties of a blindspot (e.g., is it defined with this feature?). For per-configuration factors, we average DR and FDR across the ECs. For per-blindspot factors, we report the fraction of blindspots covered averaged across each individual blindspot from the ECs (see Equation 5). The number of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Left), we plot the average DR for ECs with 1, 2, and 3 blindspots. Average DR decreases for all methods as the number of blindspots increases. Figure 3 (Center) shows that FDR increases as the number of blindspots increases. Together these observations show that BDMs perform worse in settings with multiple blindspots, which is particularly significant because past evaluations have primarily focused on settings with one blindspot. The specificity of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Right), we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots defined using 5, 6, and 7 features. With the exception of Spotlight, all of these methods are less capable of finding more specific/less frequently occurring blindspots. The features that define a blindspot matter. In Figure 4, we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots that either are or are not defined using various features. In general, we observe that the performance of these BDMs is influenced by the types of features used to define a blindspot (e.g., the presence of spurious objects, color or texture information, background information). For example, all methods are less likely to find blindspots defined using the \u201crelative position\u201d feature. Interestingly, BDMs that use the model\u2019s representation for their image representation (i.e., PlaneSpot and Spotlight) are less sensitive to the features that define a blindspot than those that use an external model\u2019s representation (i.e., Barlow and Domino). Hyperparameters matter. We make two observations about BDM hyperparameters that, jointly, suggest that it is critical that future BDMs provide ways to tune their hyperparameters. First, in Appendix C, we observe that many BDMs have significant performance differences when we vary their hyperparameters. However, hyperparameter tuning is harder in real settings than in these experiments because there is no information about the true blindspots to use. Second, in Figure 2, we observe that two hyperparameter settings that perform nearly identically on average exhibit significantly different performance at finding blindspots defined using differing numbers of features. This suggests that there may not be a single best hyperparameter choice to find all of the blindspots in a single model, which could contain multiple blindspots of different specificity or size. 5.2 REAL DATA EXPERIMENTS: We demonstrate how to design semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) to test whether or not some of the findings observed using SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. Despite the fact COCO is a fairly large dataset with extensive annotations, it does not have enough metadata to test all of the findings from SpotCheck (e.g., we cannot induce blindspots that depend on the texture of an object). Therefore, we study the following questions using real data: \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective for models with more true blindspots? \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective at finding more specific blindspots? \u2022 Will the 2D image representation used by PlaneSpot still be effective? Notice that means we we are interested in two factors: the number of blindspots in a model and of the specificity of those blindspots. Then, in order to try to estimate their influence on BDM performance, we use the same strategy as SpotCheck and generate a set of ECs where we randomize these factors independently of one another. We provide details of how we generate these ECs in Appendix E and show an example EC in Figure 5. However, one key difference from our synthetic experiments is that when we use real data, we cannot guarantee that the model will learn the blindspots that we try to induce in it. Then, if the model fails to learn the intended blindspots in a non-random way, the factors that we want to investigate may be correlated and, consequently, their effects may be confounded, which makes it difficult to estimate their individual effects. Table 3 shows that this confounding occurs between the effects of the number and the specificity of the blindspots in the COCO ECs. To eliminate this confounding, we generate a new set of ECs for each factor where we hold the other confounding factor constant. We call the set of ECs, where all of the factors are chosen independently, the general pool because it covers a wider range of possible ECs, which is better for measuring overall BDM performance. We call this new set of ECs the conditioned pool because it is generated by conditioning the distribution used to generate the general pool on specific confounding factors. Because blindspot discovery is harder with real data, we use more lenient thresholds for our metrics and set p = r = 0.5. Results. Overall, all of the findings that we observed using SpotCheck generalized to these real data experiments. In Figure 6, using the conditioned pool, we observe that BDM performance generally decreases as the number of blindspots increases. In Figure 7, using the conditioned pool, we observe that these BDMs are less able to find blindspots that are more specific. In Table 4, using the general pool, we observe that PlaneSpot is still effective on real data. These results provide evidence that results from SpotCheck may generalize to a wider range of more realistic settings. Additionally, in Appendix F, we include qualitative examples of the 2D representation used by PlaneSpot for models trained on benchmark datasets. Interpreting these results. While these results are promising, there are general challenges associated with running semi-controlled experiments on real data that influence the interpretation of these results (or the results of any similar experiments). At a high-level, these challenges all add noise (or bias) to the results. First, models trained on real data probably have naturally occurring blindspots (i.e., blindspots that we did not intend the model to learn) that may influence the results. One example of how they do this is that we do not know how many hypothesized blindspots to ask a BDM to return because we do not know how many true blindspots (including both the naturally occurring ones and the ones we induced) a model has. Second, the chosen BDM hyperparameters are probably sub-optimal because we cannot tune them for a specific EC. Because the set of ECs from the synthetic data experiments is relatively homogeneous, it is reasonable to use a single set of hyperparameters for all of those ECs. However, this is not the case for our COCO experiments. Third, the results may be biased in potentially unknown ways towards certain BDMs whenever some of the models in the set of ECs fail to learn the intended blindspots. For example, our general pool of ECs contains more less-specific blindspots than more-specific blindspots, which will bias the results towards BDMs that are more effective at finding less-specific blindspots. Further, there are probably other biases that we cannot identify because we lack the metadata needed to measure them. Fourth, there can be false positives in verifying that a model actually learned an intended blindspot. This is because there could be a sub-blindspot (that we may not have the metadata to define) within that intended blindspot that is actually causing the model to perform significantly worse on the intended blindspot. 6 CONCLUSION: In this work, we introduced SpotCheck, a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs, and PlaneSpot, a simple BDM that uses a 2D image representation. Using SpotCheck, we identified factors that influence BDM performance and two technical challenges for future work on developing new BDMs to address (i.e., providing a practical way to tune BDM hyperparameters and preventing BDMs from merging multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot). We found that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs on both synthetic and real data. Beyond the insights made in the experiments that we ran, we believe that our demonstrated evaluation workflow has laid further groundwork for a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. Researchers interested in benchmarking their own BDM or answering scientific questions about blindspot discovery can first use SpotCheck (or harder variations of it) to run controlled experiments using synthetic data. Next, researchers can also set up semi-controlled experiments using real data. While both harder and noisier (in part, because of the challenges that we identified), these experiments are also more realistic. A natural open direction for future work is how to evaluate BDMs in more realistic settings where we have no knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. We note that this workflow is particularly well suited to identifying factors that influence BDM performance and that understanding these factors can benefit both researchers and practitioners using BDMs. For researchers, understanding these factors is essential to running fair and informative experiments (e.g., only evaluating BDMs in settings that only have one blindspot, which we have identified as being easier, may misrepresent how BDMs perform in more realistic settings). For practitioners, understanding these factors may help them use any prior knowledge they may have to select an effective BDM for their problem. Two potential factors that future work could consider are: First, how does the methodology used to induce blindspots (i.e., training with mislabeled images) influence BDM performance? Second, for models trained on real data, how different are the naturally occurring blindspots from those that we have the metadata to artificially induce and how do those differences influence BDM performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will create three agents to review the paper \"Towards a More Rigorous Science of Blindspot Discovery in Image Models\".

The paper title is: Towards a More Rigorous Science of Blindspot Discovery in Image Models\\\\n\\\\n1 INTRODUCTION: A growing body of work has found that models with high test performance can still make systemic errors, which occur when the model performs significantly worse on a semantically meaningful subset of the data (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Chung et al., 2019; Oakden-Rayner et al., 2020; Singla et al., 2021; Ribeiro & Lundberg, 2022). For example, past works have demonstrated that models trained to diagnose skin cancer from dermoscopic images sometimes rely on spurious artifacts (e.g., surgical skin markers that some dermatologists use to mark lesions); consequently, they have different performance on images with or without those spurious artifacts (Winkler et al., 2019; Mahmood et al., 2021). More broadly, finding systemic errors can help us detect algorithmic bias (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) or sensitivity to distribution shifts (Sagawa et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020). In this work, we focus on what we call the blindspot discovery problem, which is the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors1 without making many of the assumptions considered in related works (e.g., we do not assume access to metadata to define semantically meaningful subsets of the data, tools to produce counterfactual images, a specific model structure or training process, or a human in the loop). We call methods for addressing this problem Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) (e.g., Kim et al., 2019; Sohoni et al., 2020; Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). We note that blindspot discovery is an emerging research area and that there has been more emphasis on developing BDMs than on formalizing the problem itself. Consequently, we propose a problem formalization, summarize different approaches for evaluating BDMs, and summarize several highlevel design choices made by BDMs. When we do this, we observe the following two gaps. First, existing evaluations are based on an incomplete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots, which limits the types of measurements and claims they can make. Second, dimensionality reduction is a relatively underexplored aspect of BDM design. Motivated by these gaps in prior work, we propose a new evaluation framework, SpotCheck, and a new BDM, PlaneSpot. SpotCheck is a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM 1In past work, \u201csystemic errors\u201d have also been called \u201cfailure modes\u201d or \u201chidden stratification.\u201d We introduce \u201cblindspot\u201d to mean the same thing and use it make it clear when we are specifically discussing blindspot discovery. performance. Additionally, we refine the metrics used by past evaluations. PlaneSpot is a simple BDM that finds blindspots using a 2D image representation. We use SpotCheck to run controlled experiments that identify factors that influence BDM performance (e.g., the number of blindspot in a model) and show that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs. We run additional semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) and find that these trends discovered using SpotCheck generalize to real image data. Overall, we hope that the methodology and analyses presented in this work will help facilitate a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. 2 BACKGROUND: In this section, we formalize the problem of blindspot discovery for image classification. We then discuss general approaches for evaluating the Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) designed to address this problem as well as high-level design choices made by BDMs. Problem Definition. The broad goal of finding systematic errors has been studied across a range of problem statements and method assumptions. Some common assumptions are: \u2022 Access to metadata help define coherent subsets of the data (e.g., Kim et al., 2018; Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Singh et al., 2020). \u2022 The ability to produce counterfactual images (e.g., Shetty et al., 2019; Singla et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021; Leclerc et al., 2021; Bharadhwaj et al., 2021; Plumb et al., 2022). \u2022 A specific structure for the model we are analyzing (e.g., Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018; Koh et al., 2020) or for training process used to learn the model\u2019s parameters (e.g., Wong et al., 2021). \u2022 A human-in-the loop, either through an interactive interface (e.g., Cabrera et al., 2019; Balayn et al., 2022) or by inspecting explanations (e.g., Yeh et al., 2020; Adebayo et al., 2022). While appropriate at times, these assumptions all restrict the applicability of their respective methods. For example, consider assuming access to metadata to help define coherent subsets of the data. To start, this metadata is much less common in applied settings than it is for common ML benchmarks. Further, the efficacy of methods that rely on this metadata is limited by the quantity and relevance of this metadata; in general, efficiently collecting large quantities of relevant metadata is challenging because it requires anticipating the model\u2019s systemic errors. Consequently, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors without making any of these assumptions. More formally, suppose that we have an image classifier, f , and a dataset of labeled images, D = [xi]ni=1. Then, a blindspot is a coherent (i.e., semantically meaningful) set of images, \u21e2 D, where f performs significantly worse (i.e., p(f, ) \u2327 p(f,D \\\\ ) for some performance metric, p, such as recall). We denote the set of f \u2019s true blindspots as : { m}Mm=1. Next, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding using only f and D. Then, a BDM is a method that takes as input f and D and outputs an ordered (by some definition of importance) list of hypothesized blindspots,  \u0302 : [ \u0302k]Kk=1. Note that the m and  \u0302k are sets of images. Approaches to BDM evaluation. We observe that existing approaches to quantitatively evaluate BDMs fall in two categories. The first category of evaluations simply measure the error rate or size of  \u0302k (Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021). However, these evaluations have two problems. First, none of the properties they measure capture whether  \u0302k is coherent (e.g., a random sample of misclassified images has high error but may not match a single semantically meaningful description). Second, f \u2019s performance on  \u0302k may not be representative of f \u2019s performance on similar images because BDMs are optimized to return high error images (e.g., suppose that f has a 90% accuracy on images of \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d; then, by returning the 10% of such images that are misclassified, a BDM could mislead us into believing that f has a 0% accuracy on this type of image). The second category of evaluations compares  \u0302 to a subset of that have either been artificially induced or previously found (Sohoni et al., 2020; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). While these evaluations address the issues with those from the first category, they require knowledge of , which is usually incomplete (i.e., we usually only know a subset of ). This incompleteness makes it difficult to identify factors that influence BDM performance or to measure a BDM\u2019s recall or false positive rate. It is fundamentally impossible to fix this incompleteness using real data because we cannot enumerate all of the possible coherent subsets of D to check if they are blindspots. To address these limitations, we introduce SpotCheck, which gives us complete knowledge of by using synthetic data. High-level design choices of BDMs. In Table 1, we summarize three of the high-level design choices made by existing BDMs. First, each BDM uses a model to extract an image representation. Many BDMs use a representation from f , but some use pre-trained external models or other models trained on D. Second, some of the BDMs apply some form of dimensionality reduction to that image representation. Third, each BDM learns a model from a specified hypothesis class to predict if an image belongs to a blindspot from that image\u2019s (potentially reduced) representation. Interestingly, while there has been significant effort focused on the choice of a BDM\u2019s image representation and hypothesis class (along with its associated learning algorithm), we note that dimensionality reduction has received much less attention. This is surprising because these BDMs are all solving clustering or learning problems, which are generally easier in lower dimensions. Motivated by this gap in prior work, we introduce a simple BDM, PlaneSpot, that uses a 2D representation. 3 EVALUATING BDMS USING KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: In Section 3.1, we introduce SpotCheck, which is an evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots by using synthetic images and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM performance. In Section 3.2, we define the metrics that we use to measure the performance of BDMs given knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. 3.1 SPOTCHECK : A SYNTHETIC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR BDMS SpotCheck builds on ideas from Kim et al. (2022) by generating synthetic datasets of varying complexity and training models to have specific blindspots on those datasets. We summarize its key steps below; see Appendix A for details. Dataset Definition. Each dataset is defined using semantic features that describe the possible types of images it contains. Datasets that have a larger number of features have a larger variety of images and are therefore more complex. For example, a simple dataset may only contain images with squares and blue or orange circles (see Figure 1), while a more complicated dataset may also contain images with striped rectangles, small text, or grey backgrounds. Blindspot Definition. Each blindspot is defined using a subset of the semantic features that define its associated dataset (see Figure 1). Similarly to how a dataset with more features is more complex, a blindspot defined using more semantic features is more specific. Training a Model to have Specific Blindspots. For each dataset and blindspot specification, we train a ResNet-18 model (He et al., 2016) to predict whether a square is present. To induce blindspots, we generate data where the label for each image in the training and validation sets is correct if and only if it does not belong to any of the blindspots (see Figure 1). The test set images are always correctly labeled. Then, because we know the full set of semantic features that define the dataset, we can verify that the model learned to have exactly the set of blindspots that we intended it to. As a result, SpotCheck gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. Generating Diverse Experimental Configurations (ECs). Since our goal is to study how various factors influence BDM performance, we generate a diverse set of experimental configurations, (i.e., dataset, blindspots, and model triplets). To do this, we randomize several factors: the features that define a dataset (both the number of them and what they are) as well as the blindspots (the number of them, the number of features that define them, and what those features are). Importantly, we sample these factors independently of one another across this set of ECs so that we can estimate their individual influence on BDM performance. 3.2 EVALUATION METRICS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: These metrics measure how well the hypothesized blindspots returned by a BDM,  \u0302, capture a model\u2019s true blindspots, . Recall that the  \u0302k and m are sets of images. To do this, we start by measuring how well a BDM finds each individual true blindspot (Blindspot Recall) and build on that to measure how well a BDM finds the complete set of true blindspots (Discovery Rate and False Discovery Rate); see Appendix B for a discussion of how these metrics refine prior definitions. Blindspot Precision. If  \u0302k is a subset of m, we know that the model underperforms on  \u0302k and that  \u0302k is coherent. We measure this using the precision of  \u0302k with respect to m: BP( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\\\ m| | \u0302k| (1) Then, we say that  \u0302k belongs to m if, for some threshold p: BP( \u0302k, m) p (2) However,  \u0302k can belong to m without capturing the same information as m. For example,  \u0302k could be \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d while m could be \u201csquares and blue or orange circles\u201d. Because this excessive specificity could result in the user arriving at conclusions that are too narrow, we need to incorporate some notion of recall into the evaluation. Blindspot Recall. One way to incorporate recall is using the proportion of m that  \u0302k covers: BRnaive( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\\\ m| | m| (3) We relax this definition by allowing m to be covered by the union of the  \u0302k that belong to it: BR( \u0302, m) = S  \u0302k:BP( \u0302k, m) p  \u0302k ! \\\\ m | m| (4) Then, we say that  \u0302 covers m if, for some threshold r: BR( \u0302, m) r (5) We do this because \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d and \u201csquares and orange circles\u201d belong to and jointly cover \u201csquares and blue or orange circles.\u201d So, if a BDM returns both, a user could combine them to arrive at the correct conclusion. Discovery Rate (DR). We define the DR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the m that  \u0302 covers: DR( \u0302, ) = 1 M X m (BR( \u0302, m) r) (6) False Discovery Rate (FDR). When the DR is non-zero, we define FDR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the  \u0302k that do not belong to any of the :2 FDR( \u0302, ) = 1 K X k (max m BP ( \u0302k, m) < p) (7) Note that it is impossible to calculate the FDR without the complete set of true blindspots. While SpotCheck gives us this knowledge, it is generally not available. 4 PLANESPOT : A SIMPLE BDM BASED ON DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION In this section, we define PlaneSpot. As shown in Table 1, PlaneSpot uses the most common choices for the image representation (i.e., f \u2019s own representation) and the hypothesis class (i.e., gaussian kernels). PlaneSpot also uses standard techniques to learn a model from that hypothesis class. As a result, the most interesting aspect of PlaneSpot\u2019s design is that it finds blindspots using a 2D representation. We start by defining some additional notation and then explain PlaneSpot\u2019s choice for each of the high-level design choices made by a BDM. Notation. Suppose that we want to find f \u2019s blindspots for a class, c, and let Dc be the set of images from D that belong to c. Further, suppose that we have divided f into two parts: g : X ! Rd, which extracts f \u2019s representation of an image (i.e., its penultimate layer activations), and h : Rd ! [0, 1], which gives f \u2019s predicted confidence for c. Image Representation. We use g to extract f \u2019s representation for Dc, G = g(Dc) 2 Rn\u21e5d, and h to extract f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H = h(G) 2 [0, 1]n\u21e51. Note that, because all of the images in Dc belong to c, entries of H closer to 1 denote higher confidence in the true class. Dimensionality Reduction. We use G to train scvis (Ding et al., 2018), which combines the objective functions of tSNE and an autoencoder, in order to learn a 2D representation of f \u2019s representation, s : Rd ! R2. Then, we use s to get the 2D representation of Dc, S = s(G) 2 Rn\u21e52. Finally, we normalize the columns of S to be in [0, 1], S\u0304 2 [0, 1]n\u21e52. Hypothesis Class. We want PlaneSpot to be aware of both the representation of Dc, S\u0304, and f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H , so we combine them into a single representation, R = [S\u0304;w \u00b7H] 2 Rn\u21e53 where w is a hyperparameter controlling the relative weight of these components. Then, we pass R to a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm, where the number of clusters is chosen using the Bayesian Information Criteria. Finally, we return those clusters in order of decreasing importance, which we define using the product of their error rate and the number of errors in them. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In Section 5.1, we use SpotCheck to run a series of controlled experiments using synthetic data. In Section 5.2, we demonstrate how to setup semi-controlled experiments to validate that the findings from SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. 2While calculating DR, we may only need the top-u items of  \u0302. As a result, we only calculate the FDR over those top-u items. This prevents the FDR from being overly pessimistic when we intentionally pick K too large in our experiments. However, it is unclear what value of u to use for ECs that have a DR of zero, so we exclude these ECs from our FDR analysis. Table 2: Average BDM DR and FDR with their standard errors across 100 SpotCheck ECs. Method DR FDR Barlow 0.43 (0.04) 0.03 (0.01) Spotlight 0.79 (0.03) 0.09 (0.01) Domino 0.64 (0.04) 0.07 (0.01) PlaneSpot 0.88 (0.03) 0.02 (0.01) 5.1 SYNTHETIC DATA EXPERIMENTS: We use SpotCheck to generate 100 ECs whose datasets have 6-8 semantic features and whose models have 1-3 blindspots defined with 5-7 features. We evaluate three recent BDMs: Spotlight (d\u2019Eon et al., 2021), Barlow (Singla et al., 2021), Domino (Eyuboglu et al., 2022), and PlaneSpot. We give all BDMs the positive examples (i.e., images with squares) from the test set and limit them to returning 10 hypothesized blindspots. We use a held-out set of 20 ECs to tune each BDM\u2019s hyperparameters (see Appendix C). We use p = r = 0.8 for our metrics. Overall Results. Table 2 shows the DR and FDR results averaged across all 100 ECs. We observe that PlaneSpot has the highest DR and that PlaneSpot and Barlow have a lower FDR than Spotlight and Domino. In Appendix D, we take a deeper look at why these BDMs are failing and conclude that a significant portion of all of their failures can be explained by their tendency to merge multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot. Identifying factors that influence BDM performance. We study two types of factors: perconfiguration factors, which measure properties of the dataset (e.g., how complex is it?) or of the model (e.g., how many blindspots does it have?), and per-blindspot factors, which measure properties of a blindspot (e.g., is it defined with this feature?). For per-configuration factors, we average DR and FDR across the ECs. For per-blindspot factors, we report the fraction of blindspots covered averaged across each individual blindspot from the ECs (see Equation 5). The number of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Left), we plot the average DR for ECs with 1, 2, and 3 blindspots. Average DR decreases for all methods as the number of blindspots increases. Figure 3 (Center) shows that FDR increases as the number of blindspots increases. Together these observations show that BDMs perform worse in settings with multiple blindspots, which is particularly significant because past evaluations have primarily focused on settings with one blindspot. The specificity of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Right), we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots defined using 5, 6, and 7 features. With the exception of Spotlight, all of these methods are less capable of finding more specific/less frequently occurring blindspots. The features that define a blindspot matter. In Figure 4, we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots that either are or are not defined using various features. In general, we observe that the performance of these BDMs is influenced by the types of features used to define a blindspot (e.g., the presence of spurious objects, color or texture information, background information). For example, all methods are less likely to find blindspots defined using the \u201crelative position\u201d feature. Interestingly, BDMs that use the model\u2019s representation for their image representation (i.e., PlaneSpot and Spotlight) are less sensitive to the features that define a blindspot than those that use an external model\u2019s representation (i.e., Barlow and Domino). Hyperparameters matter. We make two observations about BDM hyperparameters that, jointly, suggest that it is critical that future BDMs provide ways to tune their hyperparameters. First, in Appendix C, we observe that many BDMs have significant performance differences when we vary their hyperparameters. However, hyperparameter tuning is harder in real settings than in these experiments because there is no information about the true blindspots to use. Second, in Figure 2, we observe that two hyperparameter settings that perform nearly identically on average exhibit significantly different performance at finding blindspots defined using differing numbers of features. This suggests that there may not be a single best hyperparameter choice to find all of the blindspots in a single model, which could contain multiple blindspots of different specificity or size. 5.2 REAL DATA EXPERIMENTS: We demonstrate how to design semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) to test whether or not some of the findings observed using SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. Despite the fact COCO is a fairly large dataset with extensive annotations, it does not have enough metadata to test all of the findings from SpotCheck (e.g., we cannot induce blindspots that depend on the texture of an object). Therefore, we study the following questions using real data: \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective for models with more true blindspots? \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective at finding more specific blindspots? \u2022 Will the 2D image representation used by PlaneSpot still be effective? Notice that means we we are interested in two factors: the number of blindspots in a model and of the specificity of those blindspots. Then, in order to try to estimate their influence on BDM performance, we use the same strategy as SpotCheck and generate a set of ECs where we randomize these factors independently of one another. We provide details of how we generate these ECs in Appendix E and show an example EC in Figure 5. However, one key difference from our synthetic experiments is that when we use real data, we cannot guarantee that the model will learn the blindspots that we try to induce in it. Then, if the model fails to learn the intended blindspots in a non-random way, the factors that we want to investigate may be correlated and, consequently, their effects may be confounded, which makes it difficult to estimate their individual effects. Table 3 shows that this confounding occurs between the effects of the number and the specificity of the blindspots in the COCO ECs. To eliminate this confounding, we generate a new set of ECs for each factor where we hold the other confounding factor constant. We call the set of ECs, where all of the factors are chosen independently, the general pool because it covers a wider range of possible ECs, which is better for measuring overall BDM performance. We call this new set of ECs the conditioned pool because it is generated by conditioning the distribution used to generate the general pool on specific confounding factors. Because blindspot discovery is harder with real data, we use more lenient thresholds for our metrics and set p = r = 0.5. Results. Overall, all of the findings that we observed using SpotCheck generalized to these real data experiments. In Figure 6, using the conditioned pool, we observe that BDM performance generally decreases as the number of blindspots increases. In Figure 7, using the conditioned pool, we observe that these BDMs are less able to find blindspots that are more specific. In Table 4, using the general pool, we observe that PlaneSpot is still effective on real data. These results provide evidence that results from SpotCheck may generalize to a wider range of more realistic settings. Additionally, in Appendix F, we include qualitative examples of the 2D representation used by PlaneSpot for models trained on benchmark datasets. Interpreting these results. While these results are promising, there are general challenges associated with running semi-controlled experiments on real data that influence the interpretation of these results (or the results of any similar experiments). At a high-level, these challenges all add noise (or bias) to the results. First, models trained on real data probably have naturally occurring blindspots (i.e., blindspots that we did not intend the model to learn) that may influence the results. One example of how they do this is that we do not know how many hypothesized blindspots to ask a BDM to return because we do not know how many true blindspots (including both the naturally occurring ones and the ones we induced) a model has. Second, the chosen BDM hyperparameters are probably sub-optimal because we cannot tune them for a specific EC. Because the set of ECs from the synthetic data experiments is relatively homogeneous, it is reasonable to use a single set of hyperparameters for all of those ECs. However, this is not the case for our COCO experiments. Third, the results may be biased in potentially unknown ways towards certain BDMs whenever some of the models in the set of ECs fail to learn the intended blindspots. For example, our general pool of ECs contains more less-specific blindspots than more-specific blindspots, which will bias the results towards BDMs that are more effective at finding less-specific blindspots. Further, there are probably other biases that we cannot identify because we lack the metadata needed to measure them. Fourth, there can be false positives in verifying that a model actually learned an intended blindspot. This is because there could be a sub-blindspot (that we may not have the metadata to define) within that intended blindspot that is actually causing the model to perform significantly worse on the intended blindspot. 6 CONCLUSION: In this work, we introduced SpotCheck, a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs, and PlaneSpot, a simple BDM that uses a 2D image representation. Using SpotCheck, we identified factors that influence BDM performance and two technical challenges for future work on developing new BDMs to address (i.e., providing a practical way to tune BDM hyperparameters and preventing BDMs from merging multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot). We found that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs on both synthetic and real data. Beyond the insights made in the experiments that we ran, we believe that our demonstrated evaluation workflow has laid further groundwork for a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. Researchers interested in benchmarking their own BDM or answering scientific questions about blindspot discovery can first use SpotCheck (or harder variations of it) to run controlled experiments using synthetic data. Next, researchers can also set up semi-controlled experiments using real data. While both harder and noisier (in part, because of the challenges that we identified), these experiments are also more realistic. A natural open direction for future work is how to evaluate BDMs in more realistic settings where we have no knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. We note that this workflow is particularly well suited to identifying factors that influence BDM performance and that understanding these factors can benefit both researchers and practitioners using BDMs. For researchers, understanding these factors is essential to running fair and informative experiments (e.g., only evaluating BDMs in settings that only have one blindspot, which we have identified as being easier, may misrepresent how BDMs perform in more realistic settings). For practitioners, understanding these factors may help them use any prior knowledge they may have to select an effective BDM for their problem. Two potential factors that future work could consider are: First, how does the methodology used to induce blindspots (i.e., training with mislabeled images) influence BDM performance? Second, for models trained on real data, how different are the naturally occurring blindspots from those that we have the metadata to artificially induce and how do those differences influence BDM performance?Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line.', 'agent_name': 'RigorousReviewer'}, name='AskAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"message\": \"Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.\",\n  \"output\": \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

For example, past works have demonstrated that models trained to diagnose skin cancer from dermoscopic images sometimes rely on spurious artifacts (e.g., surgical skin markers that some dermatologists use to mark lesions); consequently, they have different performance on images with or without those spurious artifacts (Winkler et al., 2019; Mahmood et al., 2021). More broadly, finding systemic errors can help us detect algorithmic bias (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) or sensitivity to distribution shifts (Sagawa et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020). In this work, we focus on what we call the blindspot discovery problem, which is the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors1 without making many of the assumptions considered in related works (e.g., we do not assume access to metadata to define semantically meaningful subsets of the data, tools to produce counterfactual images, a specific model structure or training process, or a human in the loop). We call methods for addressing this problem Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) (e.g., Kim et al., 2019; Sohoni et al., 2020; Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). We note that blindspot discovery is an emerging research area and that there has been more emphasis on developing BDMs than on formalizing the problem itself. Consequently, we propose a problem formalization, summarize different approaches for evaluating BDMs, and summarize several highlevel design choices made by BDMs. When we do this, we observe the following two gaps. First, existing evaluations are based on an incomplete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots, which limits the types of measurements and claims they can make. Second, dimensionality reduction is a relatively underexplored aspect of BDM design. Motivated by these gaps in prior work, we propose a new evaluation framework, SpotCheck, and a new BDM, PlaneSpot. SpotCheck is a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM 1In past work, \u201csystemic errors\u201d have also been called \u201cfailure modes\u201d or \u201chidden stratification.\u201d We introduce \u201cblindspot\u201d to mean the same thing and use it make it clear when we are specifically discussing blindspot discovery. performance. Additionally, we refine the metrics used by past evaluations. PlaneSpot is a simple BDM that finds blindspots using a 2D image representation. We use SpotCheck to run controlled experiments that identify factors that influence BDM performance (e.g., the number of blindspot in a model) and show that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs. We run additional semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) and find that these trends discovered using SpotCheck generalize to real image data. Overall, we hope that the methodology and analyses presented in this work will help facilitate a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. 2 BACKGROUND: In this section, we formalize the problem of blindspot discovery for image classification. We then discuss general approaches for evaluating the Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) designed to address this problem as well as high-level design choices made by BDMs. Problem Definition. The broad goal of finding systematic errors has been studied across a range of problem statements and method assumptions. Some common assumptions are: \u2022 Access to metadata help define coherent subsets of the data (e.g., Kim et al., 2018; Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Singh et al., 2020). \u2022 The ability to produce counterfactual images (e.g., Shetty et al., 2019; Singla et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021; Leclerc et al., 2021; Bharadhwaj et al., 2021; Plumb et al., 2022). \u2022 A specific structure for the model we are analyzing (e.g., Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018; Koh et al., 2020) or for training process used to learn the model\u2019s parameters (e.g., Wong et al., 2021). \u2022 A human-in-the loop, either through an interactive interface (e.g., Cabrera et al., 2019; Balayn et al., 2022) or by inspecting explanations (e.g., Yeh et al., 2020; Adebayo et al., 2022). While appropriate at times, these assumptions all restrict the applicability of their respective methods. For example, consider assuming access to metadata to help define coherent subsets of the data. To start, this metadata is much less common in applied settings than it is for common ML benchmarks. Further, the efficacy of methods that rely on this metadata is limited by the quantity and relevance of this metadata; in general, efficiently collecting large quantities of relevant metadata is challenging because it requires anticipating the model\u2019s systemic errors. Consequently, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors without making any of these assumptions. More formally, suppose that we have an image classifier, f , and a dataset of labeled images, D = [xi]ni=1. Then, a blindspot is a coherent (i.e., semantically meaningful) set of images, \u21e2 D, where f performs significantly worse (i.e., p(f, ) \u2327 p(f,D \\ ) for some performance metric, p, such as recall). We denote the set of f \u2019s true blindspots as : { m}Mm=1. Next, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding using only f and D. Then, a BDM is a method that takes as input f and D and outputs an ordered (by some definition of importance) list of hypothesized blindspots,  \u0302 : [ \u0302k]Kk=1. Note that the m and  \u0302k are sets of images. Approaches to BDM evaluation. We observe that existing approaches to quantitatively evaluate BDMs fall in two categories. The first category of evaluations simply measure the error rate or size of  \u0302k (Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021). However, these evaluations have two problems. First, none of the properties they measure capture whether  \u0302k is coherent (e.g., a random sample of misclassified images has high error but may not match a single semantically meaningful description). Second, f \u2019s performance on  \u0302k may not be representative of f \u2019s performance on similar images because BDMs are optimized to return high error images (e.g., suppose that f has a 90% accuracy on images of \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d; then, by returning the 10% of such images that are misclassified, a BDM could mislead us into believing that f has a 0% accuracy on this type of image). The second category of evaluations compares  \u0302 to a subset of that have either been artificially induced or previously found (Sohoni et al., 2020; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). While these evaluations address the issues with those from the first category, they require knowledge of , which is usually incomplete (i.e., we usually only know a subset of ). This incompleteness makes it difficult to identify factors that influence BDM performance or to measure a BDM\u2019s recall or false positive rate. It is fundamentally impossible to fix this incompleteness using real data because we cannot enumerate all of the possible coherent subsets of D to check if they are blindspots. To address these limitations, we introduce SpotCheck, which gives us complete knowledge of by using synthetic data. High-level design choices of BDMs. In Table 1, we summarize three of the high-level design choices made by existing BDMs. First, each BDM uses a model to extract an image representation. Many BDMs use a representation from f , but some use pre-trained external models or other models trained on D. Second, some of the BDMs apply some form of dimensionality reduction to that image representation. Third, each BDM learns a model from a specified hypothesis class to predict if an image belongs to a blindspot from that image\u2019s (potentially reduced) representation. Interestingly, while there has been significant effort focused on the choice of a BDM\u2019s image representation and hypothesis class (along with its associated learning algorithm), we note that dimensionality reduction has received much less attention. This is surprising because these BDMs are all solving clustering or learning problems, which are generally easier in lower dimensions. Motivated by this gap in prior work, we introduce a simple BDM, PlaneSpot, that uses a 2D representation. 3 EVALUATING BDMS USING KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: In Section 3.1, we introduce SpotCheck, which is an evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots by using synthetic images and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM performance. In Section 3.2, we define the metrics that we use to measure the performance of BDMs given knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. 3.1 SPOTCHECK : A SYNTHETIC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR BDMS SpotCheck builds on ideas from Kim et al. (2022) by generating synthetic datasets of varying complexity and training models to have specific blindspots on those datasets. We summarize its key steps below; see Appendix A for details. Dataset Definition. Each dataset is defined using semantic features that describe the possible types of images it contains. Datasets that have a larger number of features have a larger variety of images and are therefore more complex. For example, a simple dataset may only contain images with squares and blue or orange circles (see Figure 1), while a more complicated dataset may also contain images with striped rectangles, small text, or grey backgrounds. Blindspot Definition. Each blindspot is defined using a subset of the semantic features that define its associated dataset (see Figure 1). Similarly to how a dataset with more features is more complex, a blindspot defined using more semantic features is more specific. Training a Model to have Specific Blindspots. For each dataset and blindspot specification, we train a ResNet-18 model (He et al., 2016) to predict whether a square is present. To induce blindspots, we generate data where the label for each image in the training and validation sets is correct if and only if it does not belong to any of the blindspots (see Figure 1). The test set images are always correctly labeled. Then, because we know the full set of semantic features that define the dataset, we can verify that the model learned to have exactly the set of blindspots that we intended it to. As a result, SpotCheck gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. Generating Diverse Experimental Configurations (ECs). Since our goal is to study how various factors influence BDM performance, we generate a diverse set of experimental configurations, (i.e., dataset, blindspots, and model triplets). To do this, we randomize several factors: the features that define a dataset (both the number of them and what they are) as well as the blindspots (the number of them, the number of features that define them, and what those features are). Importantly, we sample these factors independently of one another across this set of ECs so that we can estimate their individual influence on BDM performance. 3.2 EVALUATION METRICS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: These metrics measure how well the hypothesized blindspots returned by a BDM,  \u0302, capture a model\u2019s true blindspots, . Recall that the  \u0302k and m are sets of images. To do this, we start by measuring how well a BDM finds each individual true blindspot (Blindspot Recall) and build on that to measure how well a BDM finds the complete set of true blindspots (Discovery Rate and False Discovery Rate); see Appendix B for a discussion of how these metrics refine prior definitions. Blindspot Precision. If  \u0302k is a subset of m, we know that the model underperforms on  \u0302k and that  \u0302k is coherent. We measure this using the precision of  \u0302k with respect to m: BP( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\ m| | \u0302k| (1) Then, we say that  \u0302k belongs to m if, for some threshold p: BP( \u0302k, m) p (2) However,  \u0302k can belong to m without capturing the same information as m. For example,  \u0302k could be \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d while m could be \u201csquares and blue or orange circles\u201d. Because this excessive specificity could result in the user arriving at conclusions that are too narrow, we need to incorporate some notion of recall into the evaluation. Blindspot Recall. One way to incorporate recall is using the proportion of m that  \u0302k covers: BRnaive( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\ m| | m| (3) We relax this definition by allowing m to be covered by the union of the  \u0302k that belong to it: BR( \u0302, m) = S  \u0302k:BP( \u0302k, m) p  \u0302k ! \\ m | m| (4) Then, we say that  \u0302 covers m if, for some threshold r: BR( \u0302, m) r (5) We do this because \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d and \u201csquares and orange circles\u201d belong to and jointly cover \u201csquares and blue or orange circles.\u201d So, if a BDM returns both, a user could combine them to arrive at the correct conclusion. Discovery Rate (DR). We define the DR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the m that  \u0302 covers: DR( \u0302, ) = 1 M X m (BR( \u0302, m) r) (6) False Discovery Rate (FDR). When the DR is non-zero, we define FDR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the  \u0302k that do not belong to any of the :2 FDR( \u0302, ) = 1 K X k (max m BP ( \u0302k, m) < p) (7) Note that it is impossible to calculate the FDR without the complete set of true blindspots. While SpotCheck gives us this knowledge, it is generally not available. 4 PLANESPOT : A SIMPLE BDM BASED ON DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION In this section, we define PlaneSpot. As shown in Table 1, PlaneSpot uses the most common choices for the image representation (i.e., f \u2019s own representation) and the hypothesis class (i.e., gaussian kernels). PlaneSpot also uses standard techniques to learn a model from that hypothesis class. As a result, the most interesting aspect of PlaneSpot\u2019s design is that it finds blindspots using a 2D representation. We start by defining some additional notation and then explain PlaneSpot\u2019s choice for each of the high-level design choices made by a BDM. Notation. Suppose that we want to find f \u2019s blindspots for a class, c, and let Dc be the set of images from D that belong to c. Further, suppose that we have divided f into two parts: g : X ! Rd, which extracts f \u2019s representation of an image (i.e., its penultimate layer activations), and h : Rd ! [0, 1], which gives f \u2019s predicted confidence for c. Image Representation. We use g to extract f \u2019s representation for Dc, G = g(Dc) 2 Rn\u21e5d, and h to extract f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H = h(G) 2 [0, 1]n\u21e51. Note that, because all of the images in Dc belong to c, entries of H closer to 1 denote higher confidence in the true class. Dimensionality Reduction. We use G to train scvis (Ding et al., 2018), which combines the objective functions of tSNE and an autoencoder, in order to learn a 2D representation of f \u2019s representation, s : Rd ! R2. Then, we use s to get the 2D representation of Dc, S = s(G) 2 Rn\u21e52. Finally, we normalize the columns of S to be in [0, 1], S\u0304 2 [0, 1]n\u21e52. Hypothesis Class. We want PlaneSpot to be aware of both the representation of Dc, S\u0304, and f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H , so we combine them into a single representation, R = [S\u0304;w \u00b7H] 2 Rn\u21e53 where w is a hyperparameter controlling the relative weight of these components. Then, we pass R to a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm, where the number of clusters is chosen using the Bayesian Information Criteria. Finally, we return those clusters in order of decreasing importance, which we define using the product of their error rate and the number of errors in them. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In Section 5.1, we use SpotCheck to run a series of controlled experiments using synthetic data. In Section 5.2, we demonstrate how to setup semi-controlled experiments to validate that the findings from SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. 2While calculating DR, we may only need the top-u items of  \u0302. As a result, we only calculate the FDR over those top-u items. This prevents the FDR from being overly pessimistic when we intentionally pick K too large in our experiments. However, it is unclear what value of u to use for ECs that have a DR of zero, so we exclude these ECs from our FDR analysis. Table 2: Average BDM DR and FDR with their standard errors across 100 SpotCheck ECs. Method DR FDR Barlow 0.43 (0.04) 0.03 (0.01) Spotlight 0.79 (0.03) 0.09 (0.01) Domino 0.64 (0.04) 0.07 (0.01) PlaneSpot 0.88 (0.03) 0.02 (0.01) 5.1 SYNTHETIC DATA EXPERIMENTS: We use SpotCheck to generate 100 ECs whose datasets have 6-8 semantic features and whose models have 1-3 blindspots defined with 5-7 features. We evaluate three recent BDMs: Spotlight (d\u2019Eon et al., 2021), Barlow (Singla et al., 2021), Domino (Eyuboglu et al., 2022), and PlaneSpot. We give all BDMs the positive examples (i.e., images with squares) from the test set and limit them to returning 10 hypothesized blindspots. We use a held-out set of 20 ECs to tune each BDM\u2019s hyperparameters (see Appendix C). We use p = r = 0.8 for our metrics. Overall Results. Table 2 shows the DR and FDR results averaged across all 100 ECs. We observe that PlaneSpot has the highest DR and that PlaneSpot and Barlow have a lower FDR than Spotlight and Domino. In Appendix D, we take a deeper look at why these BDMs are failing and conclude that a significant portion of all of their failures can be explained by their tendency to merge multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot. Identifying factors that influence BDM performance. We study two types of factors: perconfiguration factors, which measure properties of the dataset (e.g., how complex is it?) or of the model (e.g., how many blindspots does it have?), and per-blindspot factors, which measure properties of a blindspot (e.g., is it defined with this feature?). For per-configuration factors, we average DR and FDR across the ECs. For per-blindspot factors, we report the fraction of blindspots covered averaged across each individual blindspot from the ECs (see Equation 5). The number of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Left), we plot the average DR for ECs with 1, 2, and 3 blindspots. Average DR decreases for all methods as the number of blindspots increases. Figure 3 (Center) shows that FDR increases as the number of blindspots increases. Together these observations show that BDMs perform worse in settings with multiple blindspots, which is particularly significant because past evaluations have primarily focused on settings with one blindspot. The specificity of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Right), we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots defined using 5, 6, and 7 features. With the exception of Spotlight, all of these methods are less capable of finding more specific/less frequently occurring blindspots. The features that define a blindspot matter. In Figure 4, we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots that either are or are not defined using various features. In general, we observe that the performance of these BDMs is influenced by the types of features used to define a blindspot (e.g., the presence of spurious objects, color or texture information, background information). For example, all methods are less likely to find blindspots defined using the \u201crelative position\u201d feature. Interestingly, BDMs that use the model\u2019s representation for their image representation (i.e., PlaneSpot and Spotlight) are less sensitive to the features that define a blindspot than those that use an external model\u2019s representation (i.e., Barlow and Domino). Hyperparameters matter. We make two observations about BDM hyperparameters that, jointly, suggest that it is critical that future BDMs provide ways to tune their hyperparameters. First, in Appendix C, we observe that many BDMs have significant performance differences when we vary their hyperparameters. However, hyperparameter tuning is harder in real settings than in these experiments because there is no information about the true blindspots to use. Second, in Figure 2, we observe that two hyperparameter settings that perform nearly identically on average exhibit significantly different performance at finding blindspots defined using differing numbers of features. This suggests that there may not be a single best hyperparameter choice to find all of the blindspots in a single model, which could contain multiple blindspots of different specificity or size. 5.2 REAL DATA EXPERIMENTS: We demonstrate how to design semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) to test whether or not some of the findings observed using SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. Despite the fact COCO is a fairly large dataset with extensive annotations, it does not have enough metadata to test all of the findings from SpotCheck (e.g., we cannot induce blindspots that depend on the texture of an object). Therefore, we study the following questions using real data: \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective for models with more true blindspots? \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective at finding more specific blindspots? \u2022 Will the 2D image representation used by PlaneSpot still be effective? Notice that means we we are interested in two factors: the number of blindspots in a model and of the specificity of those blindspots. Then, in order to try to estimate their influence on BDM performance, we use the same strategy as SpotCheck and generate a set of ECs where we randomize these factors independently of one another. We provide details of how we generate these ECs in Appendix E and show an example EC in Figure 5. However, one key difference from our synthetic experiments is that when we use real data, we cannot guarantee that the model will learn the blindspots that we try to induce in it. Then, if the model fails to learn the intended blindspots in a non-random way, the factors that we want to investigate may be correlated and, consequently, their effects may be confounded, which makes it difficult to estimate their individual effects. Table 3 shows that this confounding occurs between the effects of the number and the specificity of the blindspots in the COCO ECs. To eliminate this confounding, we generate a new set of ECs for each factor where we hold the other confounding factor constant. We call the set of ECs, where all of the factors are chosen independently, the general pool because it covers a wider range of possible ECs, which is better for measuring overall BDM performance. We call this new set of ECs the conditioned pool because it is generated by conditioning the distribution used to generate the general pool on specific confounding factors. Because blindspot discovery is harder with real data, we use more lenient thresholds for our metrics and set p = r = 0.5. Results. Overall, all of the findings that we observed using SpotCheck generalized to these real data experiments. In Figure 6, using the conditioned pool, we observe that BDM performance generally decreases as the number of blindspots increases. In Figure 7, using the conditioned pool, we observe that these BDMs are less able to find blindspots that are more specific. In Table 4, using the general pool, we observe that PlaneSpot is still effective on real data. These results provide evidence that results from SpotCheck may generalize to a wider range of more realistic settings. Additionally, in Appendix F, we include qualitative examples of the 2D representation used by PlaneSpot for models trained on benchmark datasets. Interpreting these results. While these results are promising, there are general challenges associated with running semi-controlled experiments on real data that influence the interpretation of these results (or the results of any similar experiments). At a high-level, these challenges all add noise (or bias) to the results. First, models trained on real data probably have naturally occurring blindspots (i.e., blindspots that we did not intend the model to learn) that may influence the results. One example of how they do this is that we do not know how many hypothesized blindspots to ask a BDM to return because we do not know how many true blindspots (including both the naturally occurring ones and the ones we induced) a model has. Second, the chosen BDM hyperparameters are probably sub-optimal because we cannot tune them for a specific EC. Because the set of ECs from the synthetic data experiments is relatively homogeneous, it is reasonable to use a single set of hyperparameters for all of those ECs. However, this is not the case for our COCO experiments. Third, the results may be biased in potentially unknown ways towards certain BDMs whenever some of the models in the set of ECs fail to learn the intended blindspots. For example, our general pool of ECs contains more less-specific blindspots than more-specific blindspots, which will bias the results towards BDMs that are more effective at finding less-specific blindspots. Further, there are probably other biases that we cannot identify because we lack the metadata needed to measure them. Fourth, there can be false positives in verifying that a model actually learned an intended blindspot. This is because there could be a sub-blindspot (that we may not have the metadata to define) within that intended blindspot that is actually causing the model to perform significantly worse on the intended blindspot. 6 CONCLUSION: In this work, we introduced SpotCheck, a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs, and PlaneSpot, a simple BDM that uses a 2D image representation. Using SpotCheck, we identified factors that influence BDM performance and two technical challenges for future work on developing new BDMs to address (i.e., providing a practical way to tune BDM hyperparameters and preventing BDMs from merging multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot). We found that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs on both synthetic and real data. Beyond the insights made in the experiments that we ran, we believe that our demonstrated evaluation workflow has laid further groundwork for a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. Researchers interested in benchmarking their own BDM or answering scientific questions about blindspot discovery can first use SpotCheck (or harder variations of it) to run controlled experiments using synthetic data. Next, researchers can also set up semi-controlled experiments using real data. While both harder and noisier (in part, because of the challenges that we identified), these experiments are also more realistic. A natural open direction for future work is how to evaluate BDMs in more realistic settings where we have no knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. We note that this workflow is particularly well suited to identifying factors that influence BDM performance and that understanding these factors can benefit both researchers and practitioners using BDMs. For researchers, understanding these factors is essential to running fair and informative experiments (e.g., only evaluating BDMs in settings that only have one blindspot, which we have identified as being easier, may misrepresent how BDMs perform in more realistic settings). For practitioners, understanding these factors may help them use any prior knowledge they may have to select an effective BDM for their problem. Two potential factors that future work could consider are: First, how does the methodology used to induce blindspots (i.e., training with mislabeled images) influence BDM performance? Second, for models trained on real data, how different are the naturally occurring blindspots from those that we have the metadata to artificially induce and how do those differences influence BDM performance?Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line.\",\n  \"agent_name\": \"RigorousReviewer\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

For example, past works have demonstrated that models trained to diagnose skin cancer from dermoscopic images sometimes rely on spurious artifacts (e.g., surgical skin markers that some dermatologists use to mark lesions); consequently, they have different performance on images with or without those spurious artifacts (Winkler et al., 2019; Mahmood et al., 2021). More broadly, finding systemic errors can help us detect algorithmic bias (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) or sensitivity to distribution shifts (Sagawa et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020). In this work, we focus on what we call the blindspot discovery problem, which is the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors1 without making many of the assumptions considered in related works (e.g., we do not assume access to metadata to define semantically meaningful subsets of the data, tools to produce counterfactual images, a specific model structure or training process, or a human in the loop). We call methods for addressing this problem Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) (e.g., Kim et al., 2019; Sohoni et al., 2020; Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). We note that blindspot discovery is an emerging research area and that there has been more emphasis on developing BDMs than on formalizing the problem itself. Consequently, we propose a problem formalization, summarize different approaches for evaluating BDMs, and summarize several highlevel design choices made by BDMs. When we do this, we observe the following two gaps. First, existing evaluations are based on an incomplete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots, which limits the types of measurements and claims they can make. Second, dimensionality reduction is a relatively underexplored aspect of BDM design. Motivated by these gaps in prior work, we propose a new evaluation framework, SpotCheck, and a new BDM, PlaneSpot. SpotCheck is a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM 1In past work, \u201csystemic errors\u201d have also been called \u201cfailure modes\u201d or \u201chidden stratification.\u201d We introduce \u201cblindspot\u201d to mean the same thing and use it make it clear when we are specifically discussing blindspot discovery. performance. Additionally, we refine the metrics used by past evaluations. PlaneSpot is a simple BDM that finds blindspots using a 2D image representation. We use SpotCheck to run controlled experiments that identify factors that influence BDM performance (e.g., the number of blindspot in a model) and show that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs. We run additional semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) and find that these trends discovered using SpotCheck generalize to real image data. Overall, we hope that the methodology and analyses presented in this work will help facilitate a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. 2 BACKGROUND: In this section, we formalize the problem of blindspot discovery for image classification. We then discuss general approaches for evaluating the Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) designed to address this problem as well as high-level design choices made by BDMs. Problem Definition. The broad goal of finding systematic errors has been studied across a range of problem statements and method assumptions. Some common assumptions are: \u2022 Access to metadata help define coherent subsets of the data (e.g., Kim et al., 2018; Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Singh et al., 2020). \u2022 The ability to produce counterfactual images (e.g., Shetty et al., 2019; Singla et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021; Leclerc et al., 2021; Bharadhwaj et al., 2021; Plumb et al., 2022). \u2022 A specific structure for the model we are analyzing (e.g., Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018; Koh et al., 2020) or for training process used to learn the model\u2019s parameters (e.g., Wong et al., 2021). \u2022 A human-in-the loop, either through an interactive interface (e.g., Cabrera et al., 2019; Balayn et al., 2022) or by inspecting explanations (e.g., Yeh et al., 2020; Adebayo et al., 2022). While appropriate at times, these assumptions all restrict the applicability of their respective methods. For example, consider assuming access to metadata to help define coherent subsets of the data. To start, this metadata is much less common in applied settings than it is for common ML benchmarks. Further, the efficacy of methods that rely on this metadata is limited by the quantity and relevance of this metadata; in general, efficiently collecting large quantities of relevant metadata is challenging because it requires anticipating the model\u2019s systemic errors. Consequently, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors without making any of these assumptions. More formally, suppose that we have an image classifier, f , and a dataset of labeled images, D = [xi]ni=1. Then, a blindspot is a coherent (i.e., semantically meaningful) set of images, \u21e2 D, where f performs significantly worse (i.e., p(f, ) \u2327 p(f,D \\\\ ) for some performance metric, p, such as recall). We denote the set of f \u2019s true blindspots as : { m}Mm=1. Next, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding using only f and D. Then, a BDM is a method that takes as input f and D and outputs an ordered (by some definition of importance) list of hypothesized blindspots,  \u0302 : [ \u0302k]Kk=1. Note that the m and  \u0302k are sets of images. Approaches to BDM evaluation. We observe that existing approaches to quantitatively evaluate BDMs fall in two categories. The first category of evaluations simply measure the error rate or size of  \u0302k (Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021). However, these evaluations have two problems. First, none of the properties they measure capture whether  \u0302k is coherent (e.g., a random sample of misclassified images has high error but may not match a single semantically meaningful description). Second, f \u2019s performance on  \u0302k may not be representative of f \u2019s performance on similar images because BDMs are optimized to return high error images (e.g., suppose that f has a 90% accuracy on images of \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d; then, by returning the 10% of such images that are misclassified, a BDM could mislead us into believing that f has a 0% accuracy on this type of image). The second category of evaluations compares  \u0302 to a subset of that have either been artificially induced or previously found (Sohoni et al., 2020; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). While these evaluations address the issues with those from the first category, they require knowledge of , which is usually incomplete (i.e., we usually only know a subset of ). This incompleteness makes it difficult to identify factors that influence BDM performance or to measure a BDM\u2019s recall or false positive rate. It is fundamentally impossible to fix this incompleteness using real data because we cannot enumerate all of the possible coherent subsets of D to check if they are blindspots. To address these limitations, we introduce SpotCheck, which gives us complete knowledge of by using synthetic data. High-level design choices of BDMs. In Table 1, we summarize three of the high-level design choices made by existing BDMs. First, each BDM uses a model to extract an image representation. Many BDMs use a representation from f , but some use pre-trained external models or other models trained on D. Second, some of the BDMs apply some form of dimensionality reduction to that image representation. Third, each BDM learns a model from a specified hypothesis class to predict if an image belongs to a blindspot from that image\u2019s (potentially reduced) representation. Interestingly, while there has been significant effort focused on the choice of a BDM\u2019s image representation and hypothesis class (along with its associated learning algorithm), we note that dimensionality reduction has received much less attention. This is surprising because these BDMs are all solving clustering or learning problems, which are generally easier in lower dimensions. Motivated by this gap in prior work, we introduce a simple BDM, PlaneSpot, that uses a 2D representation. 3 EVALUATING BDMS USING KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: In Section 3.1, we introduce SpotCheck, which is an evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots by using synthetic images and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM performance. In Section 3.2, we define the metrics that we use to measure the performance of BDMs given knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. 3.1 SPOTCHECK : A SYNTHETIC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR BDMS SpotCheck builds on ideas from Kim et al. (2022) by generating synthetic datasets of varying complexity and training models to have specific blindspots on those datasets. We summarize its key steps below; see Appendix A for details. Dataset Definition. Each dataset is defined using semantic features that describe the possible types of images it contains. Datasets that have a larger number of features have a larger variety of images and are therefore more complex. For example, a simple dataset may only contain images with squares and blue or orange circles (see Figure 1), while a more complicated dataset may also contain images with striped rectangles, small text, or grey backgrounds. Blindspot Definition. Each blindspot is defined using a subset of the semantic features that define its associated dataset (see Figure 1). Similarly to how a dataset with more features is more complex, a blindspot defined using more semantic features is more specific. Training a Model to have Specific Blindspots. For each dataset and blindspot specification, we train a ResNet-18 model (He et al., 2016) to predict whether a square is present. To induce blindspots, we generate data where the label for each image in the training and validation sets is correct if and only if it does not belong to any of the blindspots (see Figure 1). The test set images are always correctly labeled. Then, because we know the full set of semantic features that define the dataset, we can verify that the model learned to have exactly the set of blindspots that we intended it to. As a result, SpotCheck gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. Generating Diverse Experimental Configurations (ECs). Since our goal is to study how various factors influence BDM performance, we generate a diverse set of experimental configurations, (i.e., dataset, blindspots, and model triplets). To do this, we randomize several factors: the features that define a dataset (both the number of them and what they are) as well as the blindspots (the number of them, the number of features that define them, and what those features are). Importantly, we sample these factors independently of one another across this set of ECs so that we can estimate their individual influence on BDM performance. 3.2 EVALUATION METRICS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: These metrics measure how well the hypothesized blindspots returned by a BDM,  \u0302, capture a model\u2019s true blindspots, . Recall that the  \u0302k and m are sets of images. To do this, we start by measuring how well a BDM finds each individual true blindspot (Blindspot Recall) and build on that to measure how well a BDM finds the complete set of true blindspots (Discovery Rate and False Discovery Rate); see Appendix B for a discussion of how these metrics refine prior definitions. Blindspot Precision. If  \u0302k is a subset of m, we know that the model underperforms on  \u0302k and that  \u0302k is coherent. We measure this using the precision of  \u0302k with respect to m: BP( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\\\ m| | \u0302k| (1) Then, we say that  \u0302k belongs to m if, for some threshold p: BP( \u0302k, m) p (2) However,  \u0302k can belong to m without capturing the same information as m. For example,  \u0302k could be \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d while m could be \u201csquares and blue or orange circles\u201d. Because this excessive specificity could result in the user arriving at conclusions that are too narrow, we need to incorporate some notion of recall into the evaluation. Blindspot Recall. One way to incorporate recall is using the proportion of m that  \u0302k covers: BRnaive( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\\\ m| | m| (3) We relax this definition by allowing m to be covered by the union of the  \u0302k that belong to it: BR( \u0302, m) = S  \u0302k:BP( \u0302k, m) p  \u0302k ! \\\\ m | m| (4) Then, we say that  \u0302 covers m if, for some threshold r: BR( \u0302, m) r (5) We do this because \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d and \u201csquares and orange circles\u201d belong to and jointly cover \u201csquares and blue or orange circles.\u201d So, if a BDM returns both, a user could combine them to arrive at the correct conclusion. Discovery Rate (DR). We define the DR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the m that  \u0302 covers: DR( \u0302, ) = 1 M X m (BR( \u0302, m) r) (6) False Discovery Rate (FDR). When the DR is non-zero, we define FDR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the  \u0302k that do not belong to any of the :2 FDR( \u0302, ) = 1 K X k (max m BP ( \u0302k, m) < p) (7) Note that it is impossible to calculate the FDR without the complete set of true blindspots. While SpotCheck gives us this knowledge, it is generally not available. 4 PLANESPOT : A SIMPLE BDM BASED ON DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION In this section, we define PlaneSpot. As shown in Table 1, PlaneSpot uses the most common choices for the image representation (i.e., f \u2019s own representation) and the hypothesis class (i.e., gaussian kernels). PlaneSpot also uses standard techniques to learn a model from that hypothesis class. As a result, the most interesting aspect of PlaneSpot\u2019s design is that it finds blindspots using a 2D representation. We start by defining some additional notation and then explain PlaneSpot\u2019s choice for each of the high-level design choices made by a BDM. Notation. Suppose that we want to find f \u2019s blindspots for a class, c, and let Dc be the set of images from D that belong to c. Further, suppose that we have divided f into two parts: g : X ! Rd, which extracts f \u2019s representation of an image (i.e., its penultimate layer activations), and h : Rd ! [0, 1], which gives f \u2019s predicted confidence for c. Image Representation. We use g to extract f \u2019s representation for Dc, G = g(Dc) 2 Rn\u21e5d, and h to extract f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H = h(G) 2 [0, 1]n\u21e51. Note that, because all of the images in Dc belong to c, entries of H closer to 1 denote higher confidence in the true class. Dimensionality Reduction. We use G to train scvis (Ding et al., 2018), which combines the objective functions of tSNE and an autoencoder, in order to learn a 2D representation of f \u2019s representation, s : Rd ! R2. Then, we use s to get the 2D representation of Dc, S = s(G) 2 Rn\u21e52. Finally, we normalize the columns of S to be in [0, 1], S\u0304 2 [0, 1]n\u21e52. Hypothesis Class. We want PlaneSpot to be aware of both the representation of Dc, S\u0304, and f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H , so we combine them into a single representation, R = [S\u0304;w \u00b7H] 2 Rn\u21e53 where w is a hyperparameter controlling the relative weight of these components. Then, we pass R to a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm, where the number of clusters is chosen using the Bayesian Information Criteria. Finally, we return those clusters in order of decreasing importance, which we define using the product of their error rate and the number of errors in them. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In Section 5.1, we use SpotCheck to run a series of controlled experiments using synthetic data. In Section 5.2, we demonstrate how to setup semi-controlled experiments to validate that the findings from SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. 2While calculating DR, we may only need the top-u items of  \u0302. As a result, we only calculate the FDR over those top-u items. This prevents the FDR from being overly pessimistic when we intentionally pick K too large in our experiments. However, it is unclear what value of u to use for ECs that have a DR of zero, so we exclude these ECs from our FDR analysis. Table 2: Average BDM DR and FDR with their standard errors across 100 SpotCheck ECs. Method DR FDR Barlow 0.43 (0.04) 0.03 (0.01) Spotlight 0.79 (0.03) 0.09 (0.01) Domino 0.64 (0.04) 0.07 (0.01) PlaneSpot 0.88 (0.03) 0.02 (0.01) 5.1 SYNTHETIC DATA EXPERIMENTS: We use SpotCheck to generate 100 ECs whose datasets have 6-8 semantic features and whose models have 1-3 blindspots defined with 5-7 features. We evaluate three recent BDMs: Spotlight (d\u2019Eon et al., 2021), Barlow (Singla et al., 2021), Domino (Eyuboglu et al., 2022), and PlaneSpot. We give all BDMs the positive examples (i.e., images with squares) from the test set and limit them to returning 10 hypothesized blindspots. We use a held-out set of 20 ECs to tune each BDM\u2019s hyperparameters (see Appendix C). We use p = r = 0.8 for our metrics. Overall Results. Table 2 shows the DR and FDR results averaged across all 100 ECs. We observe that PlaneSpot has the highest DR and that PlaneSpot and Barlow have a lower FDR than Spotlight and Domino. In Appendix D, we take a deeper look at why these BDMs are failing and conclude that a significant portion of all of their failures can be explained by their tendency to merge multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot. Identifying factors that influence BDM performance. We study two types of factors: perconfiguration factors, which measure properties of the dataset (e.g., how complex is it?) or of the model (e.g., how many blindspots does it have?), and per-blindspot factors, which measure properties of a blindspot (e.g., is it defined with this feature?). For per-configuration factors, we average DR and FDR across the ECs. For per-blindspot factors, we report the fraction of blindspots covered averaged across each individual blindspot from the ECs (see Equation 5). The number of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Left), we plot the average DR for ECs with 1, 2, and 3 blindspots. Average DR decreases for all methods as the number of blindspots increases. Figure 3 (Center) shows that FDR increases as the number of blindspots increases. Together these observations show that BDMs perform worse in settings with multiple blindspots, which is particularly significant because past evaluations have primarily focused on settings with one blindspot. The specificity of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Right), we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots defined using 5, 6, and 7 features. With the exception of Spotlight, all of these methods are less capable of finding more specific/less frequently occurring blindspots. The features that define a blindspot matter. In Figure 4, we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots that either are or are not defined using various features. In general, we observe that the performance of these BDMs is influenced by the types of features used to define a blindspot (e.g., the presence of spurious objects, color or texture information, background information). For example, all methods are less likely to find blindspots defined using the \u201crelative position\u201d feature. Interestingly, BDMs that use the model\u2019s representation for their image representation (i.e., PlaneSpot and Spotlight) are less sensitive to the features that define a blindspot than those that use an external model\u2019s representation (i.e., Barlow and Domino). Hyperparameters matter. We make two observations about BDM hyperparameters that, jointly, suggest that it is critical that future BDMs provide ways to tune their hyperparameters. First, in Appendix C, we observe that many BDMs have significant performance differences when we vary their hyperparameters. However, hyperparameter tuning is harder in real settings than in these experiments because there is no information about the true blindspots to use. Second, in Figure 2, we observe that two hyperparameter settings that perform nearly identically on average exhibit significantly different performance at finding blindspots defined using differing numbers of features. This suggests that there may not be a single best hyperparameter choice to find all of the blindspots in a single model, which could contain multiple blindspots of different specificity or size. 5.2 REAL DATA EXPERIMENTS: We demonstrate how to design semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) to test whether or not some of the findings observed using SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. Despite the fact COCO is a fairly large dataset with extensive annotations, it does not have enough metadata to test all of the findings from SpotCheck (e.g., we cannot induce blindspots that depend on the texture of an object). Therefore, we study the following questions using real data: \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective for models with more true blindspots? \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective at finding more specific blindspots? \u2022 Will the 2D image representation used by PlaneSpot still be effective? Notice that means we we are interested in two factors: the number of blindspots in a model and of the specificity of those blindspots. Then, in order to try to estimate their influence on BDM performance, we use the same strategy as SpotCheck and generate a set of ECs where we randomize these factors independently of one another. We provide details of how we generate these ECs in Appendix E and show an example EC in Figure 5. However, one key difference from our synthetic experiments is that when we use real data, we cannot guarantee that the model will learn the blindspots that we try to induce in it. Then, if the model fails to learn the intended blindspots in a non-random way, the factors that we want to investigate may be correlated and, consequently, their effects may be confounded, which makes it difficult to estimate their individual effects. Table 3 shows that this confounding occurs between the effects of the number and the specificity of the blindspots in the COCO ECs. To eliminate this confounding, we generate a new set of ECs for each factor where we hold the other confounding factor constant. We call the set of ECs, where all of the factors are chosen independently, the general pool because it covers a wider range of possible ECs, which is better for measuring overall BDM performance. We call this new set of ECs the conditioned pool because it is generated by conditioning the distribution used to generate the general pool on specific confounding factors. Because blindspot discovery is harder with real data, we use more lenient thresholds for our metrics and set p = r = 0.5. Results. Overall, all of the findings that we observed using SpotCheck generalized to these real data experiments. In Figure 6, using the conditioned pool, we observe that BDM performance generally decreases as the number of blindspots increases. In Figure 7, using the conditioned pool, we observe that these BDMs are less able to find blindspots that are more specific. In Table 4, using the general pool, we observe that PlaneSpot is still effective on real data. These results provide evidence that results from SpotCheck may generalize to a wider range of more realistic settings. Additionally, in Appendix F, we include qualitative examples of the 2D representation used by PlaneSpot for models trained on benchmark datasets. Interpreting these results. While these results are promising, there are general challenges associated with running semi-controlled experiments on real data that influence the interpretation of these results (or the results of any similar experiments). At a high-level, these challenges all add noise (or bias) to the results. First, models trained on real data probably have naturally occurring blindspots (i.e., blindspots that we did not intend the model to learn) that may influence the results. One example of how they do this is that we do not know how many hypothesized blindspots to ask a BDM to return because we do not know how many true blindspots (including both the naturally occurring ones and the ones we induced) a model has. Second, the chosen BDM hyperparameters are probably sub-optimal because we cannot tune them for a specific EC. Because the set of ECs from the synthetic data experiments is relatively homogeneous, it is reasonable to use a single set of hyperparameters for all of those ECs. However, this is not the case for our COCO experiments. Third, the results may be biased in potentially unknown ways towards certain BDMs whenever some of the models in the set of ECs fail to learn the intended blindspots. For example, our general pool of ECs contains more less-specific blindspots than more-specific blindspots, which will bias the results towards BDMs that are more effective at finding less-specific blindspots. Further, there are probably other biases that we cannot identify because we lack the metadata needed to measure them. Fourth, there can be false positives in verifying that a model actually learned an intended blindspot. This is because there could be a sub-blindspot (that we may not have the metadata to define) within that intended blindspot that is actually causing the model to perform significantly worse on the intended blindspot. 6 CONCLUSION: In this work, we introduced SpotCheck, a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs, and PlaneSpot, a simple BDM that uses a 2D image representation. Using SpotCheck, we identified factors that influence BDM performance and two technical challenges for future work on developing new BDMs to address (i.e., providing a practical way to tune BDM hyperparameters and preventing BDMs from merging multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot). We found that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs on both synthetic and real data. Beyond the insights made in the experiments that we ran, we believe that our demonstrated evaluation workflow has laid further groundwork for a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. Researchers interested in benchmarking their own BDM or answering scientific questions about blindspot discovery can first use SpotCheck (or harder variations of it) to run controlled experiments using synthetic data. Next, researchers can also set up semi-controlled experiments using real data. While both harder and noisier (in part, because of the challenges that we identified), these experiments are also more realistic. A natural open direction for future work is how to evaluate BDMs in more realistic settings where we have no knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. We note that this workflow is particularly well suited to identifying factors that influence BDM performance and that understanding these factors can benefit both researchers and practitioners using BDMs. For researchers, understanding these factors is essential to running fair and informative experiments (e.g., only evaluating BDMs in settings that only have one blindspot, which we have identified as being easier, may misrepresent how BDMs perform in more realistic settings). For practitioners, understanding these factors may help them use any prior knowledge they may have to select an effective BDM for their problem. Two potential factors that future work could consider are: First, how does the methodology used to induce blindspots (i.e., training with mislabeled images) influence BDM performance? Second, for models trained on real data, how different are the naturally occurring blindspots from those that we have the metadata to artificially induce and how do those differences influence BDM performance?Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line.'}, name='AskAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"message\": \"Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.\",\n  \"output\": \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

For example, past works have demonstrated that models trained to diagnose skin cancer from dermoscopic images sometimes rely on spurious artifacts (e.g., surgical skin markers that some dermatologists use to mark lesions); consequently, they have different performance on images with or without those spurious artifacts (Winkler et al., 2019; Mahmood et al., 2021). More broadly, finding systemic errors can help us detect algorithmic bias (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) or sensitivity to distribution shifts (Sagawa et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020). In this work, we focus on what we call the blindspot discovery problem, which is the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors1 without making many of the assumptions considered in related works (e.g., we do not assume access to metadata to define semantically meaningful subsets of the data, tools to produce counterfactual images, a specific model structure or training process, or a human in the loop). We call methods for addressing this problem Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) (e.g., Kim et al., 2019; Sohoni et al., 2020; Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). We note that blindspot discovery is an emerging research area and that there has been more emphasis on developing BDMs than on formalizing the problem itself. Consequently, we propose a problem formalization, summarize different approaches for evaluating BDMs, and summarize several highlevel design choices made by BDMs. When we do this, we observe the following two gaps. First, existing evaluations are based on an incomplete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots, which limits the types of measurements and claims they can make. Second, dimensionality reduction is a relatively underexplored aspect of BDM design. Motivated by these gaps in prior work, we propose a new evaluation framework, SpotCheck, and a new BDM, PlaneSpot. SpotCheck is a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s blindspots and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM 1In past work, \u201csystemic errors\u201d have also been called \u201cfailure modes\u201d or \u201chidden stratification.\u201d We introduce \u201cblindspot\u201d to mean the same thing and use it make it clear when we are specifically discussing blindspot discovery. performance. Additionally, we refine the metrics used by past evaluations. PlaneSpot is a simple BDM that finds blindspots using a 2D image representation. We use SpotCheck to run controlled experiments that identify factors that influence BDM performance (e.g., the number of blindspot in a model) and show that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs. We run additional semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) and find that these trends discovered using SpotCheck generalize to real image data. Overall, we hope that the methodology and analyses presented in this work will help facilitate a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. 2 BACKGROUND: In this section, we formalize the problem of blindspot discovery for image classification. We then discuss general approaches for evaluating the Blindspot Discovery Methods (BDMs) designed to address this problem as well as high-level design choices made by BDMs. Problem Definition. The broad goal of finding systematic errors has been studied across a range of problem statements and method assumptions. Some common assumptions are: \u2022 Access to metadata help define coherent subsets of the data (e.g., Kim et al., 2018; Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Singh et al., 2020). \u2022 The ability to produce counterfactual images (e.g., Shetty et al., 2019; Singla et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021; Leclerc et al., 2021; Bharadhwaj et al., 2021; Plumb et al., 2022). \u2022 A specific structure for the model we are analyzing (e.g., Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018; Koh et al., 2020) or for training process used to learn the model\u2019s parameters (e.g., Wong et al., 2021). \u2022 A human-in-the loop, either through an interactive interface (e.g., Cabrera et al., 2019; Balayn et al., 2022) or by inspecting explanations (e.g., Yeh et al., 2020; Adebayo et al., 2022). While appropriate at times, these assumptions all restrict the applicability of their respective methods. For example, consider assuming access to metadata to help define coherent subsets of the data. To start, this metadata is much less common in applied settings than it is for common ML benchmarks. Further, the efficacy of methods that rely on this metadata is limited by the quantity and relevance of this metadata; in general, efficiently collecting large quantities of relevant metadata is challenging because it requires anticipating the model\u2019s systemic errors. Consequently, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding an image classification model\u2019s systemic errors without making any of these assumptions. More formally, suppose that we have an image classifier, f , and a dataset of labeled images, D = [xi]ni=1. Then, a blindspot is a coherent (i.e., semantically meaningful) set of images, \u21e2 D, where f performs significantly worse (i.e., p(f, ) \u2327 p(f,D \\ ) for some performance metric, p, such as recall). We denote the set of f \u2019s true blindspots as : { m}Mm=1. Next, we define the problem of blindspot discovery as the problem of finding using only f and D. Then, a BDM is a method that takes as input f and D and outputs an ordered (by some definition of importance) list of hypothesized blindspots,  \u0302 : [ \u0302k]Kk=1. Note that the m and  \u0302k are sets of images. Approaches to BDM evaluation. We observe that existing approaches to quantitatively evaluate BDMs fall in two categories. The first category of evaluations simply measure the error rate or size of  \u0302k (Singla et al., 2021; d\u2019Eon et al., 2021). However, these evaluations have two problems. First, none of the properties they measure capture whether  \u0302k is coherent (e.g., a random sample of misclassified images has high error but may not match a single semantically meaningful description). Second, f \u2019s performance on  \u0302k may not be representative of f \u2019s performance on similar images because BDMs are optimized to return high error images (e.g., suppose that f has a 90% accuracy on images of \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d; then, by returning the 10% of such images that are misclassified, a BDM could mislead us into believing that f has a 0% accuracy on this type of image). The second category of evaluations compares  \u0302 to a subset of that have either been artificially induced or previously found (Sohoni et al., 2020; Eyuboglu et al., 2022). While these evaluations address the issues with those from the first category, they require knowledge of , which is usually incomplete (i.e., we usually only know a subset of ). This incompleteness makes it difficult to identify factors that influence BDM performance or to measure a BDM\u2019s recall or false positive rate. It is fundamentally impossible to fix this incompleteness using real data because we cannot enumerate all of the possible coherent subsets of D to check if they are blindspots. To address these limitations, we introduce SpotCheck, which gives us complete knowledge of by using synthetic data. High-level design choices of BDMs. In Table 1, we summarize three of the high-level design choices made by existing BDMs. First, each BDM uses a model to extract an image representation. Many BDMs use a representation from f , but some use pre-trained external models or other models trained on D. Second, some of the BDMs apply some form of dimensionality reduction to that image representation. Third, each BDM learns a model from a specified hypothesis class to predict if an image belongs to a blindspot from that image\u2019s (potentially reduced) representation. Interestingly, while there has been significant effort focused on the choice of a BDM\u2019s image representation and hypothesis class (along with its associated learning algorithm), we note that dimensionality reduction has received much less attention. This is surprising because these BDMs are all solving clustering or learning problems, which are generally easier in lower dimensions. Motivated by this gap in prior work, we introduce a simple BDM, PlaneSpot, that uses a 2D representation. 3 EVALUATING BDMS USING KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: In Section 3.1, we introduce SpotCheck, which is an evaluation framework for BDMs that gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots by using synthetic images and allows us to identify factors that influence BDM performance. In Section 3.2, we define the metrics that we use to measure the performance of BDMs given knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. 3.1 SPOTCHECK : A SYNTHETIC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR BDMS SpotCheck builds on ideas from Kim et al. (2022) by generating synthetic datasets of varying complexity and training models to have specific blindspots on those datasets. We summarize its key steps below; see Appendix A for details. Dataset Definition. Each dataset is defined using semantic features that describe the possible types of images it contains. Datasets that have a larger number of features have a larger variety of images and are therefore more complex. For example, a simple dataset may only contain images with squares and blue or orange circles (see Figure 1), while a more complicated dataset may also contain images with striped rectangles, small text, or grey backgrounds. Blindspot Definition. Each blindspot is defined using a subset of the semantic features that define its associated dataset (see Figure 1). Similarly to how a dataset with more features is more complex, a blindspot defined using more semantic features is more specific. Training a Model to have Specific Blindspots. For each dataset and blindspot specification, we train a ResNet-18 model (He et al., 2016) to predict whether a square is present. To induce blindspots, we generate data where the label for each image in the training and validation sets is correct if and only if it does not belong to any of the blindspots (see Figure 1). The test set images are always correctly labeled. Then, because we know the full set of semantic features that define the dataset, we can verify that the model learned to have exactly the set of blindspots that we intended it to. As a result, SpotCheck gives us complete knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. Generating Diverse Experimental Configurations (ECs). Since our goal is to study how various factors influence BDM performance, we generate a diverse set of experimental configurations, (i.e., dataset, blindspots, and model triplets). To do this, we randomize several factors: the features that define a dataset (both the number of them and what they are) as well as the blindspots (the number of them, the number of features that define them, and what those features are). Importantly, we sample these factors independently of one another across this set of ECs so that we can estimate their individual influence on BDM performance. 3.2 EVALUATION METRICS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE BLINDSPOTS: These metrics measure how well the hypothesized blindspots returned by a BDM,  \u0302, capture a model\u2019s true blindspots, . Recall that the  \u0302k and m are sets of images. To do this, we start by measuring how well a BDM finds each individual true blindspot (Blindspot Recall) and build on that to measure how well a BDM finds the complete set of true blindspots (Discovery Rate and False Discovery Rate); see Appendix B for a discussion of how these metrics refine prior definitions. Blindspot Precision. If  \u0302k is a subset of m, we know that the model underperforms on  \u0302k and that  \u0302k is coherent. We measure this using the precision of  \u0302k with respect to m: BP( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\ m| | \u0302k| (1) Then, we say that  \u0302k belongs to m if, for some threshold p: BP( \u0302k, m) p (2) However,  \u0302k can belong to m without capturing the same information as m. For example,  \u0302k could be \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d while m could be \u201csquares and blue or orange circles\u201d. Because this excessive specificity could result in the user arriving at conclusions that are too narrow, we need to incorporate some notion of recall into the evaluation. Blindspot Recall. One way to incorporate recall is using the proportion of m that  \u0302k covers: BRnaive( \u0302k, m) = | \u0302k \\ m| | m| (3) We relax this definition by allowing m to be covered by the union of the  \u0302k that belong to it: BR( \u0302, m) = S  \u0302k:BP( \u0302k, m) p  \u0302k ! \\ m | m| (4) Then, we say that  \u0302 covers m if, for some threshold r: BR( \u0302, m) r (5) We do this because \u201csquares and blue circles\u201d and \u201csquares and orange circles\u201d belong to and jointly cover \u201csquares and blue or orange circles.\u201d So, if a BDM returns both, a user could combine them to arrive at the correct conclusion. Discovery Rate (DR). We define the DR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the m that  \u0302 covers: DR( \u0302, ) = 1 M X m (BR( \u0302, m) r) (6) False Discovery Rate (FDR). When the DR is non-zero, we define FDR of  \u0302 and as the fraction of the  \u0302k that do not belong to any of the :2 FDR( \u0302, ) = 1 K X k (max m BP ( \u0302k, m) < p) (7) Note that it is impossible to calculate the FDR without the complete set of true blindspots. While SpotCheck gives us this knowledge, it is generally not available. 4 PLANESPOT : A SIMPLE BDM BASED ON DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION In this section, we define PlaneSpot. As shown in Table 1, PlaneSpot uses the most common choices for the image representation (i.e., f \u2019s own representation) and the hypothesis class (i.e., gaussian kernels). PlaneSpot also uses standard techniques to learn a model from that hypothesis class. As a result, the most interesting aspect of PlaneSpot\u2019s design is that it finds blindspots using a 2D representation. We start by defining some additional notation and then explain PlaneSpot\u2019s choice for each of the high-level design choices made by a BDM. Notation. Suppose that we want to find f \u2019s blindspots for a class, c, and let Dc be the set of images from D that belong to c. Further, suppose that we have divided f into two parts: g : X ! Rd, which extracts f \u2019s representation of an image (i.e., its penultimate layer activations), and h : Rd ! [0, 1], which gives f \u2019s predicted confidence for c. Image Representation. We use g to extract f \u2019s representation for Dc, G = g(Dc) 2 Rn\u21e5d, and h to extract f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H = h(G) 2 [0, 1]n\u21e51. Note that, because all of the images in Dc belong to c, entries of H closer to 1 denote higher confidence in the true class. Dimensionality Reduction. We use G to train scvis (Ding et al., 2018), which combines the objective functions of tSNE and an autoencoder, in order to learn a 2D representation of f \u2019s representation, s : Rd ! R2. Then, we use s to get the 2D representation of Dc, S = s(G) 2 Rn\u21e52. Finally, we normalize the columns of S to be in [0, 1], S\u0304 2 [0, 1]n\u21e52. Hypothesis Class. We want PlaneSpot to be aware of both the representation of Dc, S\u0304, and f \u2019s predicted confidences for Dc, H , so we combine them into a single representation, R = [S\u0304;w \u00b7H] 2 Rn\u21e53 where w is a hyperparameter controlling the relative weight of these components. Then, we pass R to a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm, where the number of clusters is chosen using the Bayesian Information Criteria. Finally, we return those clusters in order of decreasing importance, which we define using the product of their error rate and the number of errors in them. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In Section 5.1, we use SpotCheck to run a series of controlled experiments using synthetic data. In Section 5.2, we demonstrate how to setup semi-controlled experiments to validate that the findings from SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. 2While calculating DR, we may only need the top-u items of  \u0302. As a result, we only calculate the FDR over those top-u items. This prevents the FDR from being overly pessimistic when we intentionally pick K too large in our experiments. However, it is unclear what value of u to use for ECs that have a DR of zero, so we exclude these ECs from our FDR analysis. Table 2: Average BDM DR and FDR with their standard errors across 100 SpotCheck ECs. Method DR FDR Barlow 0.43 (0.04) 0.03 (0.01) Spotlight 0.79 (0.03) 0.09 (0.01) Domino 0.64 (0.04) 0.07 (0.01) PlaneSpot 0.88 (0.03) 0.02 (0.01) 5.1 SYNTHETIC DATA EXPERIMENTS: We use SpotCheck to generate 100 ECs whose datasets have 6-8 semantic features and whose models have 1-3 blindspots defined with 5-7 features. We evaluate three recent BDMs: Spotlight (d\u2019Eon et al., 2021), Barlow (Singla et al., 2021), Domino (Eyuboglu et al., 2022), and PlaneSpot. We give all BDMs the positive examples (i.e., images with squares) from the test set and limit them to returning 10 hypothesized blindspots. We use a held-out set of 20 ECs to tune each BDM\u2019s hyperparameters (see Appendix C). We use p = r = 0.8 for our metrics. Overall Results. Table 2 shows the DR and FDR results averaged across all 100 ECs. We observe that PlaneSpot has the highest DR and that PlaneSpot and Barlow have a lower FDR than Spotlight and Domino. In Appendix D, we take a deeper look at why these BDMs are failing and conclude that a significant portion of all of their failures can be explained by their tendency to merge multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot. Identifying factors that influence BDM performance. We study two types of factors: perconfiguration factors, which measure properties of the dataset (e.g., how complex is it?) or of the model (e.g., how many blindspots does it have?), and per-blindspot factors, which measure properties of a blindspot (e.g., is it defined with this feature?). For per-configuration factors, we average DR and FDR across the ECs. For per-blindspot factors, we report the fraction of blindspots covered averaged across each individual blindspot from the ECs (see Equation 5). The number of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Left), we plot the average DR for ECs with 1, 2, and 3 blindspots. Average DR decreases for all methods as the number of blindspots increases. Figure 3 (Center) shows that FDR increases as the number of blindspots increases. Together these observations show that BDMs perform worse in settings with multiple blindspots, which is particularly significant because past evaluations have primarily focused on settings with one blindspot. The specificity of blindspots matters. In Figure 3 (Right), we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots defined using 5, 6, and 7 features. With the exception of Spotlight, all of these methods are less capable of finding more specific/less frequently occurring blindspots. The features that define a blindspot matter. In Figure 4, we plot the fraction of blindspots covered for blindspots that either are or are not defined using various features. In general, we observe that the performance of these BDMs is influenced by the types of features used to define a blindspot (e.g., the presence of spurious objects, color or texture information, background information). For example, all methods are less likely to find blindspots defined using the \u201crelative position\u201d feature. Interestingly, BDMs that use the model\u2019s representation for their image representation (i.e., PlaneSpot and Spotlight) are less sensitive to the features that define a blindspot than those that use an external model\u2019s representation (i.e., Barlow and Domino). Hyperparameters matter. We make two observations about BDM hyperparameters that, jointly, suggest that it is critical that future BDMs provide ways to tune their hyperparameters. First, in Appendix C, we observe that many BDMs have significant performance differences when we vary their hyperparameters. However, hyperparameter tuning is harder in real settings than in these experiments because there is no information about the true blindspots to use. Second, in Figure 2, we observe that two hyperparameter settings that perform nearly identically on average exhibit significantly different performance at finding blindspots defined using differing numbers of features. This suggests that there may not be a single best hyperparameter choice to find all of the blindspots in a single model, which could contain multiple blindspots of different specificity or size. 5.2 REAL DATA EXPERIMENTS: We demonstrate how to design semi-controlled experiments using the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) to test whether or not some of the findings observed using SpotCheck generalize to settings with real data. Despite the fact COCO is a fairly large dataset with extensive annotations, it does not have enough metadata to test all of the findings from SpotCheck (e.g., we cannot induce blindspots that depend on the texture of an object). Therefore, we study the following questions using real data: \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective for models with more true blindspots? \u2022 Are BDMs still less effective at finding more specific blindspots? \u2022 Will the 2D image representation used by PlaneSpot still be effective? Notice that means we we are interested in two factors: the number of blindspots in a model and of the specificity of those blindspots. Then, in order to try to estimate their influence on BDM performance, we use the same strategy as SpotCheck and generate a set of ECs where we randomize these factors independently of one another. We provide details of how we generate these ECs in Appendix E and show an example EC in Figure 5. However, one key difference from our synthetic experiments is that when we use real data, we cannot guarantee that the model will learn the blindspots that we try to induce in it. Then, if the model fails to learn the intended blindspots in a non-random way, the factors that we want to investigate may be correlated and, consequently, their effects may be confounded, which makes it difficult to estimate their individual effects. Table 3 shows that this confounding occurs between the effects of the number and the specificity of the blindspots in the COCO ECs. To eliminate this confounding, we generate a new set of ECs for each factor where we hold the other confounding factor constant. We call the set of ECs, where all of the factors are chosen independently, the general pool because it covers a wider range of possible ECs, which is better for measuring overall BDM performance. We call this new set of ECs the conditioned pool because it is generated by conditioning the distribution used to generate the general pool on specific confounding factors. Because blindspot discovery is harder with real data, we use more lenient thresholds for our metrics and set p = r = 0.5. Results. Overall, all of the findings that we observed using SpotCheck generalized to these real data experiments. In Figure 6, using the conditioned pool, we observe that BDM performance generally decreases as the number of blindspots increases. In Figure 7, using the conditioned pool, we observe that these BDMs are less able to find blindspots that are more specific. In Table 4, using the general pool, we observe that PlaneSpot is still effective on real data. These results provide evidence that results from SpotCheck may generalize to a wider range of more realistic settings. Additionally, in Appendix F, we include qualitative examples of the 2D representation used by PlaneSpot for models trained on benchmark datasets. Interpreting these results. While these results are promising, there are general challenges associated with running semi-controlled experiments on real data that influence the interpretation of these results (or the results of any similar experiments). At a high-level, these challenges all add noise (or bias) to the results. First, models trained on real data probably have naturally occurring blindspots (i.e., blindspots that we did not intend the model to learn) that may influence the results. One example of how they do this is that we do not know how many hypothesized blindspots to ask a BDM to return because we do not know how many true blindspots (including both the naturally occurring ones and the ones we induced) a model has. Second, the chosen BDM hyperparameters are probably sub-optimal because we cannot tune them for a specific EC. Because the set of ECs from the synthetic data experiments is relatively homogeneous, it is reasonable to use a single set of hyperparameters for all of those ECs. However, this is not the case for our COCO experiments. Third, the results may be biased in potentially unknown ways towards certain BDMs whenever some of the models in the set of ECs fail to learn the intended blindspots. For example, our general pool of ECs contains more less-specific blindspots than more-specific blindspots, which will bias the results towards BDMs that are more effective at finding less-specific blindspots. Further, there are probably other biases that we cannot identify because we lack the metadata needed to measure them. Fourth, there can be false positives in verifying that a model actually learned an intended blindspot. This is because there could be a sub-blindspot (that we may not have the metadata to define) within that intended blindspot that is actually causing the model to perform significantly worse on the intended blindspot. 6 CONCLUSION: In this work, we introduced SpotCheck, a synthetic evaluation framework for BDMs, and PlaneSpot, a simple BDM that uses a 2D image representation. Using SpotCheck, we identified factors that influence BDM performance and two technical challenges for future work on developing new BDMs to address (i.e., providing a practical way to tune BDM hyperparameters and preventing BDMs from merging multiple true blindspots into a single hypothesized blindspot). We found that PlaneSpot outperforms existing BDMs on both synthetic and real data. Beyond the insights made in the experiments that we ran, we believe that our demonstrated evaluation workflow has laid further groundwork for a more rigorous science of blindspot discovery. Researchers interested in benchmarking their own BDM or answering scientific questions about blindspot discovery can first use SpotCheck (or harder variations of it) to run controlled experiments using synthetic data. Next, researchers can also set up semi-controlled experiments using real data. While both harder and noisier (in part, because of the challenges that we identified), these experiments are also more realistic. A natural open direction for future work is how to evaluate BDMs in more realistic settings where we have no knowledge of the model\u2019s true blindspots. We note that this workflow is particularly well suited to identifying factors that influence BDM performance and that understanding these factors can benefit both researchers and practitioners using BDMs. For researchers, understanding these factors is essential to running fair and informative experiments (e.g., only evaluating BDMs in settings that only have one blindspot, which we have identified as being easier, may misrepresent how BDMs perform in more realistic settings). For practitioners, understanding these factors may help them use any prior knowledge they may have to select an effective BDM for their problem. Two potential factors that future work could consider are: First, how does the methodology used to induce blindspots (i.e., training with mislabeled images) influence BDM performance? Second, for models trained on real data, how different are the naturally occurring blindspots from those that we have the metadata to artificially induce and how do those differences influence BDM performance?Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line.\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
