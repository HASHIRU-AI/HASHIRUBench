The paper title is: Unsupervised Non-Parametric Signal Separation Using Bayesian Neural Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Neural networks as predictive models have been wildly successful across a variety of domains, be it image recognition or language modeling. And while they may be used to make predictions on previously unseen samples, one of fundamental weaknesses of traditional neural networks is the inability to quantify the prediction uncertainty. Evaluation of prediction uncertainty is important in basic research (identification of fundamental laws), reinforcement learning (identification of value functions), anomaly detection, etc. Uncertainty quantification in neural networks has been addressed both from frequentist (see, for instance, Pearce et al. (2018)) and Bayesian ( Kendall and Gal (2017)) sides. In the Bayesian setting it was naturally proposed to promote the weights of neural layers to normally distributed random variables (MacKay (1992)). Later it was shown that the learnt uncertainty in the weights improves generalization in non-linear regression problems, and it can be applied to drive the explorationexploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning ( Blundell et al. (2015)). Depeweg et al. (2017) designed a method of separation of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric. Epistemic uncertainty expresses uncertainties inherent to the model and can not be reduced with additional observations, whereas aleatoric uncertainty captures the amount of noise due to training on a specific sample. In physics the former and latter are referred to as the systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively. In treating both types of uncertainty within the same framework authors essentially bridged the gap towards graphical models. Graphical models, unlike traditional neural networks, are probabilistic in nature and allow for incorporation of prior beliefs with respect to models. They are flexible in representing various processes and allow for introduction of latent degrees of freedom. Initially graphical models used various point distribution as building blocks, while mostly normal distribution has been promoted to a random in the notable example of Gaussian random fields. In this work we propose using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) as building blocks in graphical models and demonstrate the power of synthesis of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and BNNs on a synthetic example of signal/background separation. As a demonstration of our approach we propose the additive mixture model: a superposition of signal and background spectra whose proportion varies in space. During inference we are able to learn the proportion of signal and background and their spectral shapes that match ground truth values to adequate precision. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recapitulate the feed-forward (vanilla) BNN and the variational inference approach. In Section 3 we present the transformations of a vanilla BNN that allow to emulate various distribution fields. To illustrate the power of composition of transformed BNNs in Section 4 we introduce a model of additive BNN mixture. In Section 5 we describe our experiments and in Section 6 we discuss the results and evaluate model performance. In Section 7 we conclude by a discussion of limitations as well as prospective domains of applications of our framework. 2 BACKGROUND: VANILLA BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK: We consider feed-forward deep neural architectures that are composed of dense layers. A dense layer k is an affine transformation Lk with weightWk and bias Bk that is followed by an element-wise non-linear transformation \u03c3: hk = Lk \u25e6 hk\u22121 = \u03c3(hk\u22121Wk + Bk), also known as the activation function. In our experiments we set \u03c3 to be ReLU , defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x). In what follows we work with a simple linear deep architecture which is defined as a consecutive application (composition) of dense layers: y = LK \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7L1 \u25e6 x . In order to enable probabilistic interpretation of inference using neural networks, the weights and the biases of each layer are promoted to random variables and are sampled from a Normal distribution with corresponding parameters: Wk \u223c N(\u00b5W ,\u03a3W), Bk \u223c N(\u00b5B,\u03a3B). In Fig. 1, right panel we depict an elementary Bayesian Neural Network, composed of k layers and that takes as input x, consisting of N samples, and rendering y as output, using plate notation. We consider a simple BNN in the spirit of (Blundell et al. (2015)), where authors use stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman et al. (2013); Wingate and Weber (2013)) for Gaussian posterior distributions from prior distributions of weights, biases and observations. Under these conditions it is natural to use Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) (Mehta et al. (2019)) as the loss function. ELBO loss consists of two terms: log evidence of the observable variable x with learnable parameters \u03b8, log p\u03b8(x), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximation of the posterior distribution q\u03c6(z), parametrized by \u03c6, and the true posterior p\u03b8(z|x): ELBO = log p\u03b8(x)\u2212 KL (q\u03c6(z)||p\u03b8(z|x)) . (1) Taking steps in \u03c6 to increase ELBO, increases log evidence and decreases the distance between the prior and the posterior. We further illustrate this in Fig. 1, left. Inference results depend on the choice of the optimizer, the learning rate and the number of iterations. 3 TRANSFORMED BNNS: Non-trivial examples of probabilistic models combine distributions of various types. Consider a K-component Gaussian Mixture model: each component of the mixture is normally distributed, where the mean parameterized by real-valued parameters and the scale - by a positive parameter, while the overall proportions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Xk \u223c Dir(\u03b1), which, in turn, is parameterized by a positive vector \u03b11, . . . \u03b1K > 0, and Xk belong to a K \u2212 1 simplex: \u2211 Xk = 1. We are therefore motivated to introduce a family of transformed BNNs with various ranges. In this manuscript we consider exponential transformation (transforms unconstrained vector of K dimensions to a positive vector of K dimensions) and a stick breaking transformation (unconstrained vector of K \u2212 1 dimensions into a simplex vector of K dimensions). We propose to apply transformations after the last layer of BNN, in such a way that the range of the output is constrained to be strictly positive for the exponential transform and a k-dimensional vector summing to unity (k-simplex) for the stick breaking transformation. In what follows we denote vector y sampled from a Bayesian neural network as y \u223c BNN(x, (W,B)). We denote BNN outputs transformed by exponential and stick-breaking transforms BNNe and BNNs, respectively. Another type of BNN transformation we consider is prompted by probability distributions: in certain applications it is particularly useful to work not just with positive random fields but with normalized positive random fields. Practically such a transformation consists of an approximate normalization of the BNN output given the data. 4 ADDITIVE MIXTURE: Having introduced architectures with a single dense unit BNN, we turn to a non-trivial test of our framework: a generative additive mixture model. In this model we consider two types of coordinates: we refer to x as the spatial coordinate and p as the spectral coordinate. We consider two positive spectral functions g1(p) and g2(p) that are mixed in a spatially dependent manner by a simplex-valued \u03b2(x), and suppose that only their sum f(x, p) is observed: f(x, p) = \u03b2(x)g1(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b2(x))g2(p). (2) This model is motivated by the problem of identification of spectrum of signal g2(p) in the presence of non-trivial noise g1(p). We assume that gl(p) are normalized: \u222b dpgl(p) = 1. It follows immediately that f(x) = \u222b dp f(x, p) is equal to 1 for each x. Spectral functions gl(p) are positive-valued and we model them by an exponentially transformed BNNe. We model \u03b2(x) as a Dirichlet random field \u03b2(x) \u223c Dir(\u03b1l(x)), where \u03b1l(x) = N\u03b3l(x) and \u03b3 \u223c BNNs(x) (stick-breaking transformed BNN). In order to deal with degeneracy due to the permutation symmetry: g1 \u2194 g2 and \u03b2 \u2194 1\u2212 \u03b2 we set the initial value of \u03b3l to correspond to an asymmetric proportion. e.g (0.99, 0.01), where the first component represents the background, while the other - the signal. To further discourage the inference engine from splitting the observed signal between components uniformly we introduce another observable, the relative entropy between spectral components g1(p) and g2(p) : DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) = \u222b g2(p) ln(g2(p)/g1(p)) and set it to a large number, e.g ., 100. The first observed term forces the combination of gl(p) and \u03b2(x) to approximate yi. The term containing relative entropy forces to learn maximally different g1(p) and g2(p), since DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) is a proxy to distance in function space. The objective of the inference is to identify optimal model parameters \u03c6\u03b2 and \u03c6g and thus to obtain the full spatial and spectral description of the mixture, i .e., the shapes of gl(p) and the mixing proportion \u03b2(x). In the current formulation the additive mixture model does not include Bayesian treatment aleatoric uncertainty, observations are sampled using a small fixed variance (0.002). 5 EXPERIMENTS: BNN abstractions and experiments were implemented1 in Pyro (version 1.5.2) (Bingham et al. (2019)), a probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and based on pytorch, which enables Bayesian probabilistic modeling thanks to Monte Carlo and variational inference engines. In our experiments we use unit BNNs containing 3 hidden layers of dimensions 32\u00d7 128\u00d7 32. Inference. We use Pyro\u2019s stochastic variational inference (SVI) abstraction which computes ELBO loss and take steps in the space of \u201cguide\u201d parameters \u03c6 along the gradients of loss function. As a whole the procedure is a Bayesian update: it identifies variational parameters \u03c6 of the true posterior approximation q\u03c6(z). In what follows we use Clipped Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) (Kingma and Ba (2014)) as the optimization method and, unless mentioned otherwise, set the learning rate to 10\u22122, the clipping norm to 10, and default values for the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square: (0.9, 0.999). The value of the ELBO loss is computed for each epoch. The relative values of the loss with respect to the previous iterations is computed too. For a chosen window, the former are compared with two conditions. We improve the inference procedure in an empiric manner by restarting it with a decreasing value of learning rate (factor of 0.5 in our case), while keeping current \u201cguide\u201d parameters. The restart happens if (i) the last Sp steps resulted in an increased loss or (ii) the last Sr steps resulted in a relative loss below a certain threshold. Both Sp and Sr are chosen to be 3 in the current project. Condition (i) means that the inference engine is diverging from optimal region of the parameter space (likely due to the stochastic nature of sampling), which manifests in the divergence of loss function. This procedure is repeated until a fixed number of steps are performed. Training of unit BNNs. Unit vanilla and transformed BNNs introduced in Section 3 may be used to approximate functions or as latent constituents of more complex models. When using them as latent parts of more complex models it is often advantageous to impose certain priors on their functional 1Implementation available at https://github.com/repo_url. form, e.g ., we might want to represent the prior knowledge of mixture composition, which is not directly observed. In other words latent components of a complex model can be pre-trained so that their priors condition the output to have the desired shape. If the prior and the \u201cguide\u201d have the same functional form, this procedure can be viewed as a Bayesian update. Using learned during pre-training \u201cguide\u201d parameters to initialize the \u201cguide\u201d when a given unit BNN is used as a constituent may improve convergence. In short we go through the following steps: (i) generate a data sample emulating desired shape, (ii) fit a unit BNN to the generated data sample using non-informative priors, thus obtaining \u201cguide\u201d parameters, and (iii) use inferred guide parameters as prior parameters and (optionally) as the initial \u201cguide\u201d parameters as part of a more complex model. The second step involves sampling BNN output to match observations. Since we are not interested in aleatoric component at this stage, we represent it as a constant and use normal, log-normal and Dirichlet for sampling. We illustrate the process of inference of a unit BNN on the example of approximating g?(p) \u223c e 1 1+p2 \u2212 1, shifted by b = \u22122.5 (and normalized to 1). To fit this positive function we use an exponentially transformed BNNe, which is sampled using log-normal distribution after the last layer by convention. The inferred posterior distribution of the inference on a unit BNN is shown in the left panel, the loss - in the second-to-left, the location parameters \u00b5 of weightsW of the last hidden layer of given BNN a function of epoch - in the second-to-right and the evolution of scale parameters \u03a3 - in the right panel of Fig. 3. The inferred posterior distribution matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model. Synthetic Additive Mixture. By considering the additive mixture model we answer the following fundamental question: if a superposition of two spectral (i .e. positive) functions is observed as a function of spatial coordinates, can we learn their shapes and proportions, given a minimum amount of information? To test our method for the additive mixture model we create a synthetic dataset containing triples D = {(xi, pi, fi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 R, pi \u2208 R, where xi and pi are sampled uniformly on [\u22125, 5] and refer to this particular implementation as the Signal/Background (SB) model. The values of f(xi, pi) are derived using the generative model of Sec. 4 with deterministic gl(p) and deterministic \u03b2(x). In what follows we refer to g1(p) and g2(p) as the background and the signal, respectively. We consider (i) case A where non-informative priors are used, and (ii) case B where only g1(p) is conditioned. For both of them we use a previously introduced template g\u2217(p) (normalized to 1), which we shifted by b = 2.5 in two directions: g1(p) = g\u2217(p\u2212 b) and g2(p) = g\u2217(p+ b). First we demonstrate that the inference works for a specific choice of \u03b2: we choose \u03b2(x) to be a logistic function with values at \u2212\u221e equal to 0.99 and +\u221e equal to 0.5. Afterwards we test the limit of our approach by considering synthetic datasets with decreasingly small proportion of \u201csignal\u201d. \u03b2(x) and gl(p) are represented by a stick-breaking and an exponentially transformed BNNs (see Sec. 4), hereafter referred as to BNN\u03b2 and BNNg, respectively. Both of them have output dimensions equal to 2. The prior distributions for (W , B) of all hidden layers of BNN\u03b2 and BNNg are taken to be \u223c N(0, 0.1). It is instructive to representBNN\u03b2(x,W,B) graphically as a function of x, whereW,B are sampled from prior distributions: in Fig. 5 the mean values are plotted as dashed lines together with the 68% containment bands as shaded areas for case A and case B in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Location parameters of theW for the last hidden layer of BNN\u03b2 as a function of epoch are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The scale parameters are shown in the middle panel of the same figure. The right panel shows the ELBO loss as a function of epoch. The top panels show the results for case A and the bottom panels for case A. For the case of non-informative prior the variation of the means is negligible after 700 epochs. In the case where the g1 is conditioned, locations hyperparameters converge to their terminal values after 500 epochs. 6 RESULTS: In what follows, we set \u03b2(x) to vary continuously from \u03b2T |x=\u22125 = 0.99 in the backgrounddominated spatial region to \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 in the mixture region. The inferred posterior distribution of 1-\u03b2(x) and gl(p) are shown in Fig. 5 for proportion in the mixture region of \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 for cases A and B in the upper and lower, left and second-to-left panels, respectively. The inferred posterior distribution for 1-\u03b2(x) matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model for cases A and B. For case B, the relative error between the true signal proportion at x = 5, i.e. 1-\u03b2T |x=5, and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 8% and the prediction of g2 is in agreement with true values within 95% confidence level. For case A, the relative error between the true signal proportion and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 9% but the ground truth values of g2 are not contained in the 95% confidence band. We also run a series of experiments by changing \u03c1 = \u03b2T (x=5) (1\u2212\u03b2T (x=5)) in the ground truth data, or, in other words, the ground truth background fraction value at the right boundary, which may be interpreted as the noise-to-signal ratio. Each experiment is repeated several times with random seeds to help us mapping the distribution. In Fig. 6, we plot the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the prediction of the corresponding constituent BNN after the SB inference and the true value of 1-\u03b2 and gl, respectively, as a function of \u03c1. We note that the variation of RMSD for g1 over the whole range of \u03c1 is small. We also note that the error in identification of g2 and 1-\u03b2 increases with increase of \u03c1, potentially due to the fact that the inference procedure is no longer able to distinguish a small signal from the fixed aleatoric noise. 7 DISCUSSION: In this work we introduced a framework that merges the powers of Bayesian neural networks and graphical models and demonstrated its validity on a proof of concept model of signal/background separation. This framework allows to compose BNNs, representing random fields, in the same way point distributions are composed in graphical models. Our proof of concept model is motivated by the astrophysical problem of learning of an unknown signal in the presence of a potentially unknown background, which manifests at various wavelengths. We lift this traditionally treated by parametric statistical methods and more recently using Bayesian statistics (see, for instance, Abdallah et al. (2016; 2018; 2020); Abdalla et al. (2021)) problem, thanks to the power of neural networks, to a new level of non-parametric inference. Our approach is non-parametric with respect to proportions and spectral shapes and also Bayesian; it allows for Bayesian updates: to incorporate available extra information and to aggregate spectral descriptions by class (study sources that we believe belong to the same class). We outline several possible improvements and generalizations that will be addressed in future work. \u2022 At the heart of our framework of representing random fields by BNNs is a non-linear transformation of a neural network layer, that renders the output positive. According to Jensen inequality increasing the scales parametrizing a BNN will lead to a greater expectation value of the output (as well as hidden layers). This might lead to a potential problem during inference using ELBO loss, where matching expected values (of potentially latent random variables) might be achieved by increasing the scale parameter, instead of increasing the location parameter, at the same time rendering log probabilities for the sampled distribution irrelevant (as in any data fits equally well a very wide Gaussian). \u2022 From the point of view of physical modeling of signal/background separation, our model is built upon several simplifications: it does not include an explicit model of the measurement, nor does it contain a microscopic emission model. It also posits space-energy factorization, that energy-spectra are spatially independent, which is not the case if the target (gas, radiation) density fields are strongly spatially-dependent. The gamma-ray signal expected from cosmic ray interaction in the interstellar medium would therefore exhibit a spatially-dependent spectral behavior. All the above points maybe address within the current framework. \u2022 In SB model we considered the separation of total signal into two components in one spatial dimension. In astrophysics and cosmology raw observations are made in two spatial coordinates and time. Our framework allows very easily to extend the number of spatial dimensions. Increasing the number of components on the hand should be done with caution as it decreases the stability of inference due to appearance of extra permutation symmetries. \u2022 The additive mixture example was focused on identification of epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty may be represented as a parameter or another unit BNN. \u2022 SB model was demonstrated to apply in a limited signal-to-noise ratio region. While this might be due to our choice of fixed aleatoric scale, it is possible that inference using ELBO loss becomes less stable, when smaller scales are chosen. SB model may be directly applied in gamma-ray, cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational astrophysics. The framework, however, is far more general and could be used, in the context of Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), where the total household consumption signal is disaggregated into multiple house appliances and over-fitting problem is of particular importance (Jones et al. (2020)). Other applications include Bayesian modeling of value function in reinforcement learning (Eriksson et al. (2020)) and audio source separation (Schulze-Forster et al. (2022))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will create three agents to review the paper and provide a final decision.

The paper title is: Unsupervised Non-Parametric Signal Separation Using Bayesian Neural Networks. INTRODUCTION: Neural networks as predictive models have been wildly successful across a variety of domains, be it image recognition or language modeling. And while they may be used to make predictions on previously unseen samples, one of fundamental weaknesses of traditional neural networks is the inability to quantify the prediction uncertainty. Evaluation of prediction uncertainty is important in basic research (identification of fundamental laws), reinforcement learning (identification of value functions), anomaly detection, etc. Uncertainty quantification in neural networks has been addressed both from frequentist (see, for instance, Pearce et al. (2018)) and Bayesian ( Kendall and Gal (2017)) sides. In the Bayesian setting it was naturally proposed to promote the weights of neural layers to normally distributed random variables (MacKay (1992)). Later it was shown that the learnt uncertainty in the weights improves generalization in non-linear regression problems, and it can be applied to drive the explorationexploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning ( Blundell et al. (2015)). Depeweg et al. (2017) designed a method of separation of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric. Epistemic uncertainty expresses uncertainties inherent to the model and can not be reduced with additional observations, whereas aleatoric uncertainty captures the amount of noise due to training on a specific sample. In physics the former and latter are referred to as the systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively. In treating both types of uncertainty within the same framework authors essentially bridged the gap towards graphical models. Graphical models, unlike traditional neural networks, are probabilistic in nature and allow for incorporation of prior beliefs with respect to models. They are flexible in representing various processes and allow for introduction of latent degrees of freedom. Initially graphical models used various point distribution as building blocks, while mostly normal distribution has been promoted to a random in the notable example of Gaussian random fields. In this work we propose using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) as building blocks in graphical models and demonstrate the power of synthesis of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and BNNs on a synthetic example of signal/background separation. As a demonstration of our approach we propose the additive mixture model: a superposition of signal and background spectra whose proportion varies in space. During inference we are able to learn the proportion of signal and background and their spectral shapes that match ground truth values to adequate precision. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recapitulate the feed-forward (vanilla) BNN and the variational inference approach. In Section 3 we present the transformations of a vanilla BNN that allow to emulate various distribution fields. To illustrate the power of composition of transformed BNNs in Section 4 we introduce a model of additive BNN mixture. In Section 5 we describe our experiments and in Section 6 we discuss the results and evaluate model performance. In Section 7 we conclude by a discussion of limitations as well as prospective domains of applications of our framework. 2 BACKGROUND: VANILLA BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK: We consider feed-forward deep neural architectures that are composed of dense layers. A dense layer k is an affine transformation Lk with weightWk and bias Bk that is followed by an element-wise non-linear transformation \u03c3: hk = Lk \u25e6 hk\u22121 = \u03c3(hk\u22121Wk + Bk), also known as the activation function. In our experiments we set \u03c3 to be ReLU , defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x). In what follows we work with a simple linear deep architecture which is defined as a consecutive application (composition) of dense layers: y = LK \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7L1 \u25e6 x . In order to enable probabilistic interpretation of inference using neural networks, the weights and the biases of each layer are promoted to random variables and are sampled from a Normal distribution with corresponding parameters: Wk \u223c N(\u00b5W ,\u03a3W), Bk \u223c N(\u00b5B,\u03a3B). In Fig. 1, right panel we depict an elementary Bayesian Neural Network, composed of k layers and that takes as input x, consisting of N samples, and rendering y as output, using plate notation. We consider a simple BNN in the spirit of (Blundell et al. (2015)), where authors use stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman et al. (2013); Wingate and Weber (2013)) for Gaussian posterior distributions from prior distributions of weights, biases and observations. Under these conditions it is natural to use Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) (Mehta et al. (2019)) as the loss function. ELBO loss consists of two terms: log evidence of the observable variable x with learnable parameters \u03b8, log p\u03b8(x), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximation of the posterior distribution q\u03c6(z), parametrized by \u03c6, and the true posterior p\u03b8(z|x): ELBO = log p\u03b8(x)\u2212 KL (q\u03c6(z)||p\u03b8(z|x)) . (1) Taking steps in \u03c6 to increase ELBO, increases log evidence and decreases the distance between the prior and the posterior. We further illustrate this in Fig. 1, left. Inference results depend on the choice of the optimizer, the learning rate and the number of iterations. 3 TRANSFORMED BNNS: Non-trivial examples of probabilistic models combine distributions of various types. Consider a K-component Gaussian Mixture model: each component of the mixture is normally distributed, where the mean parameterized by real-valued parameters and the scale - by a positive parameter, while the overall proportions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Xk \u223c Dir(\u03b1), which, in turn, is parameterized by a positive vector \u03b11, . . . \u03b1K > 0, and Xk belong to a K \u2212 1 simplex: \u2211 Xk = 1. We are therefore motivated to introduce a family of transformed BNNs with various ranges. In this manuscript we consider exponential transformation (transforms unconstrained vector of K dimensions to a positive vector of K dimensions) and a stick breaking transformation (unconstrained vector of K \u2212 1 dimensions into a simplex vector of K dimensions). We propose to apply transformations after the last layer of BNN, in such a way that the range of the output is constrained to be strictly positive for the exponential transform and a k-dimensional vector summing to unity (k-simplex) for the stick breaking transformation. In what follows we denote vector y sampled from a Bayesian neural network as y \u223c BNN(x, (W,B)). We denote BNN outputs transformed by exponential and stick-breaking transforms BNNe and BNNs, respectively. Another type of BNN transformation we consider is prompted by probability distributions: in certain applications it is particularly useful to work not just with positive random fields but with normalized positive random fields. Practically such a transformation consists of an approximate normalization of the BNN output given the data. 4 ADDITIVE MIXTURE: Having introduced architectures with a single dense unit BNN, we turn to a non-trivial test of our framework: a generative additive mixture model. In this model we consider two types of coordinates: we refer to x as the spatial coordinate and p as the spectral coordinate. We consider two positive spectral functions g1(p) and g2(p) that are mixed in a spatially dependent manner by a simplex-valued \u03b2(x), and suppose that only their sum f(x, p) is observed: f(x, p) = \u03b2(x)g1(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b2(x))g2(p). (2) This model is motivated by the problem of identification of spectrum of signal g2(p) in the presence of non-trivial noise g1(p). We assume that gl(p) are normalized: \u222b dpgl(p) = 1. It follows immediately that f(x) = \u222b dp f(x, p) is equal to 1 for each x. Spectral functions gl(p) are positive-valued and we model them by an exponentially transformed BNNe. We model \u03b2(x) as a Dirichlet random field \u03b2(x) \u223c Dir(\u03b1l(x)), where \u03b1l(x) = N\u03b3l(x) and \u03b3 \u223c BNNs(x) (stick-breaking transformed BNN). In order to deal with degeneracy due to the permutation symmetry: g1 \u2194 g2 and \u03b2 \u2194 1\u2212 \u03b2 we set the initial value of \u03b3l to correspond to an asymmetric proportion. e.g (0.99, 0.01), where the first component represents the background, while the other - the signal. To further discourage the inference engine from splitting the observed signal between components uniformly we introduce another observable, the relative entropy between spectral components g1(p) and g2(p) : DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) = \u222b g2(p) ln(g2(p)/g1(p)) and set it to a large number, e.g ., 100. The first observed term forces the combination of gl(p) and \u03b2(x) to approximate yi. The term containing relative entropy forces to learn maximally different g1(p) and g2(p), since DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) is a proxy to distance in function space. The objective of the inference is to identify optimal model parameters \u03c6\u03b2 and \u03c6g and thus to obtain the full spatial and spectral description of the mixture, i .e., the shapes of gl(p) and the mixing proportion \u03b2(x). In the current formulation the additive mixture model does not include Bayesian treatment aleatoric uncertainty, observations are sampled using a small fixed variance (0.002). 5 EXPERIMENTS: BNN abstractions and experiments were implemented1 in Pyro (version 1.5.2) (Bingham et al. (2019)), a probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and based on pytorch, which enables Bayesian probabilistic modeling thanks to Monte Carlo and variational inference engines. In our experiments we use unit BNNs containing 3 hidden layers of dimensions 32\u00d7 128\u00d7 32. Inference. We use Pyro\u2019s stochastic variational inference (SVI) abstraction which computes ELBO loss and take steps in the space of \u201cguide\u201d parameters \u03c6 along the gradients of loss function. As a whole the procedure is a Bayesian update: it identifies variational parameters \u03c6 of the true posterior approximation q\u03c6(z). In what follows we use Clipped Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) (Kingma and Ba (2014)) as the optimization method and, unless mentioned otherwise, set the learning rate to 10\u22122, the clipping norm to 10, and default values for the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square: (0.9, 0.999). The value of the ELBO loss is computed for each epoch. The relative values of the loss with respect to the previous iterations is computed too. For a chosen window, the former are compared with two conditions. We improve the inference procedure in an empiric manner by restarting it with a decreasing value of learning rate (factor of 0.5 in our case), while keeping current \u201cguide\u201d parameters. The restart happens if (i) the last Sp steps resulted in an increased loss or (ii) the last Sr steps resulted in a relative loss below a certain threshold. Both Sp and Sr are chosen to be 3 in the current project. Condition (i) means that the inference engine is diverging from optimal region of the parameter space (likely due to the stochastic nature of sampling), which manifests in the divergence of loss function. This procedure is repeated until a fixed number of steps are performed. Training of unit BNNs. Unit vanilla and transformed BNNs introduced in Section 3 may be used to approximate functions or as latent constituents of more complex models. When using them as latent parts of more complex models it is often advantageous to impose certain priors on their functional 1Implementation available at https://github.com/repo_url. form, e.g ., we might want to represent the prior knowledge of mixture composition, which is not directly observed. In other words latent components of a complex model can be pre-trained so that their priors condition the output to have the desired shape. If the prior and the \u201cguide\u201d have the same functional form, this procedure can be viewed as a Bayesian update. Using learned during pre-training \u201cguide\u201d parameters to initialize the \u201cguide\u201d when a given unit BNN is used as a constituent may improve convergence. In short we go through the following steps: (i) generate a data sample emulating desired shape, (ii) fit a unit BNN to the generated data sample using non-informative priors, thus obtaining \u201cguide\u201d parameters, and (iii) use inferred guide parameters as prior parameters and (optionally) as the initial \u201cguide\u201d parameters as part of a more complex model. The second step involves sampling BNN output to match observations. Since we are not interested in aleatoric component at this stage, we represent it as a constant and use normal, log-normal and Dirichlet for sampling. We illustrate the process of inference of a unit BNN on the example of approximating g?(p) \u223c e 1 1+p2 \u2212 1, shifted by b = \u22122.5 (and normalized to 1). To fit this positive function we use an exponentially transformed BNNe, which is sampled using log-normal distribution after the last layer by convention. The inferred posterior distribution of the inference on a unit BNN is shown in the left panel, the loss - in the second-to-left, the location parameters \u00b5 of weightsW of the last hidden layer of given BNN a function of epoch - in the second-to-right and the evolution of scale parameters \u03a3 - in the right panel of Fig. 3. The inferred posterior distribution matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model. Synthetic Additive Mixture. By considering the additive mixture model we answer the following fundamental question: if a superposition of two spectral (i .e. positive) functions is observed as a function of spatial coordinates, can we learn their shapes and proportions, given a minimum amount of information? To test our method for the additive mixture model we create a synthetic dataset containing triples D = {(xi, pi, fi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 R, pi \u2208 R, where xi and pi are sampled uniformly on [\u22125, 5] and refer to this particular implementation as the Signal/Background (SB) model. The values of f(xi, pi) are derived using the generative model of Sec. 4 with deterministic gl(p) and deterministic \u03b2(x). In what follows we refer to g1(p) and g2(p) as the background and the signal, respectively. We consider (i) case A where non-informative priors are used, and (ii) case B where only g1(p) is conditioned. For both of them we use a previously introduced template g\u2217(p) (normalized to 1), which we shifted by b = 2.5 in two directions: g1(p) = g\u2217(p\u2212 b) and g2(p) = g\u2217(p+ b). First we demonstrate that the inference works for a specific choice of \u03b2: we choose \u03b2(x) to be a logistic function with values at \u2212\u221e equal to 0.99 and +\u221e equal to 0.5. Afterwards we test the limit of our approach by considering synthetic datasets with decreasingly small proportion of \u201csignal\u201d. \u03b2(x) and gl(p) are represented by a stick-breaking and an exponentially transformed BNNs (see Sec. 4), hereafter referred as to BNN\u03b2 and BNNg, respectively. Both of them have output dimensions equal to 2. The prior distributions for (W , B) of all hidden layers of BNN\u03b2 and BNNg are taken to be \u223c N(0, 0.1). It is instructive to representBNN\u03b2(x,W,B) graphically as a function of x, whereW,B are sampled from prior distributions: in Fig. 5 the mean values are plotted as dashed lines together with the 68% containment bands as shaded areas for case A and case B in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Location parameters of theW for the last hidden layer of BNN\u03b2 as a function of epoch are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The scale parameters are shown in the middle panel of the same figure. The right panel shows the ELBO loss as a function of epoch. The top panels show the results for case A and the bottom panels for case A. For the case of non-informative prior the variation of the means is negligible after 700 epochs. In the case where the g1 is conditioned, locations hyperparameters converge to their terminal values after 500 epochs. 6 RESULTS: In what follows, we set \u03b2(x) to vary continuously from \u03b2T |x=\u22125 = 0.99 in the backgrounddominated spatial region to \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 in the mixture region. The inferred posterior distribution of 1-\u03b2(x) and gl(p) are shown in Fig. 5 for proportion in the mixture region of \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 for cases A and B in the upper and lower, left and second-to-left panels, respectively. The inferred posterior distribution for 1-\u03b2(x) matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model for cases A and B. For case B, the relative error between the true signal proportion at x = 5, i.e. 1-\u03b2T |x=5, and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 8% and the prediction of g2 is in agreement with true values within 95% confidence level. For case A, the relative error between the true signal proportion and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 9% but the ground truth values of g2 are not contained in the 95% confidence band. We also run a series of experiments by changing \u03c1 = \u03b2T (x=5) (1\u2212\u03b2T (x=5)) in the ground truth data, or, in other words, the ground truth background fraction value at the right boundary, which may be interpreted as the noise-to-signal ratio. Each experiment is repeated several times with random seeds to help us mapping the distribution. In Fig. 6, we plot the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the prediction of the corresponding constituent BNN after the SB inference and the true value of 1-\u03b2 and gl, respectively, as a function of \u03c1. We note that the variation of RMSD for g1 over the whole range of \u03c1 is small. We also note that the error in identification of g2 and 1-\u03b2 increases with increase of \u03c1, potentially due to the fact that the inference procedure is no longer able to distinguish a small signal from the fixed aleatoric noise. 7 DISCUSSION: In this work we introduced a framework that merges the powers of Bayesian neural networks and graphical models and demonstrated its validity on a proof of concept model of signal/background separation. This framework allows to compose BNNs, representing random fields, in the same way point distributions are composed in graphical models. Our proof of concept model is motivated by the astrophysical problem of learning of an unknown signal in the presence of a potentially unknown background, which manifests at various wavelengths. We lift this traditionally treated by parametric statistical methods and more recently using Bayesian statistics (see, for instance, Abdallah et al. (2016; 2018; 2020); Abdalla et al. (2021)) problem, thanks to the power of neural networks, to a new level of non-parametric inference. Our approach is non-parametric with respect to proportions and spectral shapes and also Bayesian; it allows for Bayesian updates: to incorporate available extra information and to aggregate spectral descriptions by class (study sources that we believe belong to the same class). We outline several possible improvements and generalizations that will be addressed in future work. \u2022 At the heart of our framework of representing random fields by BNNs is a non-linear transformation of a neural network layer, that renders the output positive. According to Jensen inequality increasing the scales parametrizing a BNN will lead to a greater expectation value of the output (as well as hidden layers). This might lead to a potential problem during inference using ELBO loss, where matching expected values (of potentially latent random variables) might be achieved by increasing the scale parameter, instead of increasing the location parameter, at the same time rendering log probabilities for the sampled distribution irrelevant (as in any data fits equally well a very wide Gaussian). \u2022 From the point of view of physical modeling of signal/background separation, our model is built upon several simplifications: it does not include an explicit model of the measurement, nor does it contain a microscopic emission model. It also posits space-energy factorization, that energy-spectra are spatially independent, which is not the case if the target (gas, radiation) density fields are strongly spatially-dependent. The gamma-ray signal expected from cosmic ray interaction in the interstellar medium would therefore exhibit a spatially-dependent spectral behavior. All the above points maybe address within the current framework. \u2022 In SB model we considered the separation of total signal into two components in one spatial dimension. In astrophysics and cosmology raw observations are made in two spatial coordinates and time. Our framework allows very easily to extend the number of spatial dimensions. Increasing the number of components on the hand should be done with caution as it decreases the stability of inference due to appearance of extra permutation symmetries. \u2022 The additive mixture example was focused on identification of epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty may be represented as a parameter or another unit BNN. \u2022 SB model was demonstrated to apply in a limited signal-to-noise ratio region. While this might be due to our choice of fixed aleatoric scale, it is possible that inference using ELBO loss becomes less stable, when smaller scales are chosen. SB model may be directly applied in gamma-ray, cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational astrophysics. The framework, however, is far more general and could be used, in the context of Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), where the total household consumption signal is disaggregated into multiple house appliances and over-fitting problem is of particular importance (Jones et al. (2020)). Other applications include Bayesian modeling of value function in reinforcement learning (Eriksson et al. (2020)) and audio source separation (Schulze-Forster et al.

The paper title is: Unsupervised Non-Parametric Signal Separation Using Bayesian Neural Networks. INTRODUCTION: Neural networks as predictive models have been wildly successful across a variety of domains, be it image recognition or language modeling. And while they may be used to make predictions on previously unseen samples, one of fundamental weaknesses of traditional neural networks is the inability to quantify the prediction uncertainty. Evaluation of prediction uncertainty is important in basic research (identification of fundamental laws), reinforcement learning (identification of value functions), anomaly detection, etc. Uncertainty quantification in neural networks has been addressed both from frequentist (see, for instance, Pearce et al. (2018)) and Bayesian ( Kendall and Gal (2017)) sides. In the Bayesian setting it was naturally proposed to promote the weights of neural layers to normally distributed random variables (MacKay (1992)). Later it was shown that the learnt uncertainty in the weights improves generalization in non-linear regression problems, and it can be applied to drive the explorationexploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning ( Blundell et al. (2015)). Depeweg et al. (2017) designed a method of separation of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric. Epistemic uncertainty expresses uncertainties inherent to the model and can not be reduced with additional observations, whereas aleatoric uncertainty captures the amount of noise due to training on a specific sample. In physics the former and latter are referred to as the systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively. In treating both types of uncertainty within the same framework authors essentially bridged the gap towards graphical models. Graphical models, unlike traditional neural networks, are probabilistic in nature and allow for incorporation of prior beliefs with respect to models. They are flexible in representing various processes and allow for introduction of latent degrees of freedom. Initially graphical models used various point distribution as building blocks, while mostly normal distribution has been promoted to a random in the notable example of Gaussian random fields. In this work we propose using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) as building blocks in graphical models and demonstrate the power of synthesis of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and BNNs on a synthetic example of signal/background separation. As a demonstration of our approach we propose the additive mixture model: a superposition of signal and background spectra whose proportion varies in space. During inference we are able to learn the proportion of signal and background and their spectral shapes that match ground truth values to adequate precision. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recapitulate the feed-forward (vanilla) BNN and the variational inference approach. In Section 3 we present the transformations of a vanilla BNN that allow to emulate various distribution fields. To illustrate the power of composition of transformed BNNs in Section 4 we introduce a model of additive BNN mixture. In Section 5 we describe our experiments and in Section 6 we discuss the results and evaluate model performance. In Section 7 we conclude by a discussion of limitations as well as prospective domains of applications of our framework. 2 BACKGROUND: VANILLA BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK: We consider feed-forward deep neural architectures that are composed of dense layers. A dense layer k is an affine transformation Lk with weightWk and bias Bk that is followed by an element-wise non-linear transformation \u03c3: hk = Lk \u25e6 hk\u22121 = \u03c3(hk\u22121Wk + Bk), also known as the activation function. In our experiments we set \u03c3 to be ReLU , defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x). In what follows we work with a simple linear deep architecture which is defined as a consecutive application (composition) of dense layers: y = LK \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7L1 \u25e6 x . In order to enable probabilistic interpretation of inference using neural networks, the weights and the biases of each layer are promoted to random variables and are sampled from a Normal distribution with corresponding parameters: Wk \u223c N(\u00b5W ,\u03a3W), Bk \u223c N(\u00b5B,\u03a3B). In Fig. 1, right panel we depict an elementary Bayesian Neural Network, composed of k layers and that takes as input x, consisting of N samples, and rendering y as output, using plate notation. We consider a simple BNN in the spirit of (Blundell et al. (2015)), where authors use stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman et al. (2013); Wingate and Weber (2013)) for Gaussian posterior distributions from prior distributions of weights, biases and observations. Under these conditions it is natural to use Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) (Mehta et al. (2019)) as the loss function. ELBO loss consists of two terms: log evidence of the observable variable x with learnable parameters \u03b8, log p\u03b8(x), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximation of the posterior distribution q\u03c6(z), parametrized by \u03c6, and the true posterior p\u03b8(z|x): ELBO = log p\u03b8(x)\u2212 KL (q\u03c6(z)||p\u03b8(z|x)) . (1) Taking steps in \u03c6 to increase ELBO, increases log evidence and decreases the distance between the prior and the posterior. We further illustrate this in Fig. 1, left. Inference results depend on the choice of the optimizer, the learning rate and the number of iterations. 3 TRANSFORMED BNNS: Non-trivial examples of probabilistic models combine distributions of various types. Consider a K-component Gaussian Mixture model: each component of the mixture is normally distributed, where the mean parameterized by real-valued parameters and the scale - by a positive parameter, while the overall proportions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Xk \u223c Dir(\u03b1), which, in turn, is parameterized by a positive vector \u03b11, . . . \u03b1K > 0, and Xk belong to a K \u2212 1 simplex: \u2211 Xk = 1. We are therefore motivated to introduce a family of transformed BNNs with various ranges. In this manuscript we consider exponential transformation (transforms unconstrained vector of K dimensions to a positive vector of K dimensions) and a stick breaking transformation (unconstrained vector of K \u2212 1 dimensions into a simplex vector of K dimensions). We propose to apply transformations after the last layer of BNN, in such a way that the range of the output is constrained to be strictly positive for the exponential transform and a k-dimensional vector summing to unity (k-simplex) for the stick breaking transformation. In what follows we denote vector y sampled from a Bayesian neural network as y \u223c BNN(x, (W,B)). We denote BNN outputs transformed by exponential and stick-breaking transforms BNNe and BNNs, respectively. Another type of BNN transformation we consider is prompted by probability distributions: in certain applications it is particularly useful to work not just with positive random fields but with normalized positive random fields. Practically such a transformation consists of an approximate normalization of the BNN output given the data. 4 ADDITIVE MIXTURE: Having introduced architectures with a single dense unit BNN, we turn to a non-trivial test of our framework: a generative additive mixture model. In this model we consider two types of coordinates: we refer to x as the spatial coordinate and p as the spectral coordinate. We consider two positive spectral functions g1(p) and g2(p) that are mixed in a spatially dependent manner by a simplex-valued \u03b2(x), and suppose that only their sum f(x, p) is observed: f(x, p) = \u03b2(x)g1(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b2(x))g2(p). (2) This model is motivated by the problem of identification of spectrum of signal g2(p) in the presence of non-trivial noise g1(p). We assume that gl(p) are normalized: \u222b dpgl(p) = 1. It follows immediately that f(x) = \u222b dp f(x, p) is equal to 1 for each x. Spectral functions gl(p) are positive-valued and we model them by an exponentially transformed BNNe. We model \u03b2(x) as a Dirichlet random field \u03b2(x) \u223c Dir(\u03b1l(x)), where \u03b1l(x) = N\u03b3l(x) and \u03b3 \u223c BNNs(x) (stick-breaking transformed BNN). In order to deal with degeneracy due to the permutation symmetry: g1 \u2194 g2 and \u03b2 \u2194 1\u2212 \u03b2 we set the initial value of \u03b3l to correspond to an asymmetric proportion. e.g (0.99, 0.01), where the first component represents the background, while the other - the signal. To further discourage the inference engine from splitting the observed signal between components uniformly we introduce another observable, the relative entropy between spectral components g1(p) and g2(p) : DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) = \u222b g2(p) ln(g2(p)/g1(p)) and set it to a large number, e.g ., 100. The first observed term forces the combination of gl(p) and \u03b2(x) to approximate yi. The term containing relative entropy forces to learn maximally different g1(p) and g2(p), since DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) is a proxy to distance in function space. The objective of the inference is to identify optimal model parameters \u03c6\u03b2 and \u03c6g and thus to obtain the full spatial and spectral description of the mixture, i .e., the shapes of gl(p) and the mixing proportion \u03b2(x). In the current formulation the additive mixture model does not include Bayesian treatment aleatoric uncertainty, observations are sampled using a small fixed variance (0.002). 5 EXPERIMENTS: BNN abstractions and experiments were implemented1 in Pyro (version 1.5.2) (Bingham et al. (2019)), a probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and based on pytorch, which enables Bayesian probabilistic modeling thanks to Monte Carlo and variational inference engines. In our experiments we use unit BNNs containing 3 hidden layers of dimensions 32\u00d7 128\u00d7 32. Inference. We use Pyro\u2019s stochastic variational inference (SVI) abstraction which computes ELBO loss and take steps in the space of \u201cguide\u201d parameters \u03c6 along the gradients of loss function. As a whole the procedure is a Bayesian update: it identifies variational parameters \u03c6 of the true posterior approximation q\u03c6(z). In what follows we use Clipped Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) (Kingma and Ba (2014)) as the optimization method and, unless mentioned otherwise, set the learning rate to 10\u22122, the clipping norm to 10, and default values for the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square: (0.9, 0.999). The value of the ELBO loss is computed for each epoch. The relative values of the loss with respect to the previous iterations is computed too. For a chosen window, the former are compared with two conditions. We improve the inference procedure in an empiric manner by restarting it with a decreasing value of learning rate (factor of 0.5 in our case), while keeping current \u201cguide\u201d parameters. The restart happens if (i) the last Sp steps resulted in an increased loss or (ii) the last Sr steps resulted in a relative loss below a certain threshold. Both Sp and Sr are chosen to be 3 in the current project. Condition (i) means that the inference engine is diverging from optimal region of the parameter space (likely due to the stochastic nature of sampling), which manifests in the divergence of loss function. This procedure is repeated until a fixed number of steps are performed. Training of unit BNNs. Unit vanilla and transformed BNNs introduced in Section 3 may be used to approximate functions or as latent constituents of more complex models. When using them as latent parts of more complex models it is often advantageous to impose certain priors on their functional 1Implementation available at https://github.com/repo_url. form, e.g ., we might want to represent the prior knowledge of mixture composition, which is not directly observed. In other words latent components of a complex model can be pre-trained so that their priors condition the output to have the desired shape. If the prior and the \u201cguide\u201d have the same functional form, this procedure can be viewed as a Bayesian update. Using learned during pre-training \u201cguide\u201d parameters to initialize the \u201cguide\u201d when a given unit BNN is used as a constituent may improve convergence. In short we go through the following steps: (i) generate a data sample emulating desired shape, (ii) fit a unit BNN to the generated data sample using non-informative priors, thus obtaining \u201cguide\u201d parameters, and (iii) use inferred guide parameters as prior parameters and (optionally) as the initial \u201cguide\u201d parameters as part of a more complex model. The second step involves sampling BNN output to match observations. Since we are not interested in aleatoric component at this stage, we represent it as a constant and use normal, log-normal and Dirichlet for sampling. We illustrate the process of inference of a unit BNN on the example of approximating g?(p) \u223c e 1 1+p2 \u2212 1, shifted by b = \u22122.5 (and normalized to 1). To fit this positive function we use an exponentially transformed BNNe, which is sampled using log-normal distribution after the last layer by convention. The inferred posterior distribution of the inference on a unit BNN is shown in the left panel, the loss - in the second-to-left, the location parameters \u00b5 of weightsW of the last hidden layer of given BNN a function of epoch - in the second-to-right and the evolution of scale parameters \u03a3 - in the right panel of Fig. 3. The inferred posterior distribution matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model. Synthetic Additive Mixture. By considering the additive mixture model we answer the following fundamental question: if a superposition of two spectral (i .e. positive) functions is observed as a function of spatial coordinates, can we learn their shapes and proportions, given a minimum amount of information? To test our method for the additive mixture model we create a synthetic dataset containing triples D = {(xi, pi, fi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 R, pi \u2208 R, where xi and pi are sampled uniformly on [\u22125, 5] and refer to this particular implementation as the Signal/Background (SB) model. The values of f(xi, pi) are derived using the generative model of Sec. 4 with deterministic gl(p) and deterministic \u03b2(x). In what follows we refer to g1(p) and g2(p) as the background and the signal, respectively. We consider (i) case A where non-informative priors are used, and (ii) case B where only g1(p) is conditioned. For both of them we use a previously introduced template g\u2217(p) (normalized to 1), which we shifted by b = 2.5 in two directions: g1(p) = g\u2217(p\u2212 b) and g2(p) = g\u2217(p+ b). First we demonstrate that the inference works for a specific choice of \u03b2: we choose \u03b2(x) to be a logistic function with values at \u2212\u221e equal to 0.99 and +\u221e equal to 0.5. Afterwards we test the limit of our approach by considering synthetic datasets with decreasingly small proportion of \u201csignal\u201d. \u03b2(x) and gl(p) are represented by a stick-breaking and an exponentially transformed BNNs (see Sec. 4), hereafter referred as to BNN\u03b2 and BNNg, respectively. Both of them have output dimensions equal to 2. The prior distributions for (W , B) of all hidden layers of BNN\u03b2 and BNNg are taken to be \u223c N(0, 0.1). It is instructive to representBNN\u03b2(x,W,B) graphically as a function of x, whereW,B are sampled from prior distributions: in Fig. 5 the mean values are plotted as dashed lines together with the 68% containment bands as shaded areas for case A and case B in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Location parameters of theW for the last hidden layer of BNN\u03b2 as a function of epoch are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The scale parameters are shown in the middle panel of the same figure. The right panel shows the ELBO loss as a function of epoch. The top panels show the results for case A and the bottom panels for case A. For the case of non-informative prior the variation of the means is negligible after 700 epochs. In the case where the g1 is conditioned, locations hyperparameters converge to their terminal values after 500 epochs. 6 RESULTS: In what follows, we set \u03b2(x) to vary continuously from \u03b2T |x=\u22125 = 0.99 in the backgrounddominated spatial region to \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 in the mixture region. The inferred posterior distribution of 1-\u03b2(x) and gl(p) are shown in Fig. 5 for proportion in the mixture region of \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 for cases A and B in the upper and lower, left and second-to-left panels, respectively. The inferred posterior distribution for 1-\u03b2(x) matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model for cases A and B. For case B, the relative error between the true signal proportion at x = 5, i.e. 1-\u03b2T |x=5, and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 8% and the prediction of g2 is in agreement with true values within 95% confidence level. For case A, the relative error between the true signal proportion and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 9% but the ground truth values of g2 are not contained in the 95% confidence band. We also run a series of experiments by changing \u03c1 = \u03b2T (x=5) (1\u2212\u03b2T (x=5)) in the ground truth data, or, in other words, the ground truth background fraction value at the right boundary, which may be interpreted as the noise-to-signal ratio. Each experiment is repeated several times with random seeds to help us mapping the distribution. In Fig. 6, we plot the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the prediction of the corresponding constituent BNN after the SB inference and the true value of 1-\u03b2 and gl, respectively, as a function of \u03c1. We note that the variation of RMSD for g1 over the whole range of \u03c1 is small. We also note that the error in identification of g2 and 1-\u03b2 increases with increase of \u03c1, potentially due to the fact that the inference procedure is no longer able to distinguish a small signal from the fixed aleatoric noise. 7 DISCUSSION: In this work we introduced a framework that merges the powers of Bayesian neural networks and graphical models and demonstrated its validity on a proof of concept model of signal/background separation. This framework allows to compose BNNs, representing random fields, in the same way point distributions are composed in graphical models. Our proof of concept model is motivated by the astrophysical problem of learning of an unknown signal in the presence of a potentially unknown background, which manifests at various wavelengths. We lift this traditionally treated by parametric statistical methods and more recently using Bayesian statistics (see, for instance, Abdallah et al. (2016; 2018; 2020); Abdalla et al. (2021)) problem, thanks to the power of neural networks, to a new level of non-parametric inference. Our approach is non-parametric with respect to proportions and spectral shapes and also Bayesian; it allows for Bayesian updates: to incorporate available extra information and to aggregate spectral descriptions by class (study sources that we believe belong to the same class). We outline several possible improvements and generalizations that will be addressed in future work. \u2022 At the heart of our framework of representing random fields by BNNs is a non-linear transformation of a neural network layer, that renders the output positive. According to Jensen inequality increasing the scales parametrizing a BNN will lead to a greater expectation value of the output (as well as hidden layers). This might lead to a potential problem during inference using ELBO loss, where matching expected values (of potentially latent random variables) might be achieved by increasing the scale parameter, instead of increasing the location parameter, at the same time rendering log probabilities for the sampled distribution irrelevant (as in any data fits equally well a very wide Gaussian). \u2022 From the point of view of physical modeling of signal/background separation, our model is built upon several simplifications: it does not include an explicit model of the measurement, nor does it contain a microscopic emission model. It also posits space-energy factorization, that energy-spectra are spatially independent, which is not the case if the target (gas, radiation) density fields are strongly spatially-dependent. The gamma-ray signal expected from cosmic ray interaction in the interstellar medium would therefore exhibit a spatially-dependent spectral behavior. All the above points maybe address within the current framework. \u2022 In SB model we considered the separation of total signal into two components in one spatial dimension. In astrophysics and cosmology raw observations are made in two spatial coordinates and time. Our framework allows very easily to extend the number of spatial dimensions. Increasing the number of components on the hand should be done with caution as it decreases the stability of inference due to appearance of extra permutation symmetries. \u2022 The additive mixture example was focused on identification of epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty may be represented as a parameter or another unit BNN. \u2022 SB model was demonstrated to apply in a limited signal-to-noise ratio region. While this might be due to our choice of fixed aleatoric scale, it is possible that inference using ELBO loss becomes less stable, when smaller scales are chosen. SB model may be directly applied in gamma-ray, cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational astrophysics. The framework, however, is far more general and could be used, in the context of Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), where the total household consumption signal is disaggregated into multiple house appliances and over-fitting problem is of particular importance (Jones et al. (2020)). Other applications include Bayesian modeling of value function in reinforcement learning (Eriksson et al. (2020)) and audio source separation (Schulze-Forster et al. (2022)).Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line.\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

The paper title is: Unsupervised Non-Parametric Signal Separation Using Bayesian Neural Networks. INTRODUCTION: Neural networks as predictive models have been wildly successful across a variety of domains, be it image recognition or language modeling. And while they may be used to make predictions on previously unseen samples, one of fundamental weaknesses of traditional neural networks is the inability to quantify the prediction uncertainty. Evaluation of prediction uncertainty is important in basic research (identification of fundamental laws), reinforcement learning (identification of value functions), anomaly detection, etc. Uncertainty quantification in neural networks has been addressed both from frequentist (see, for instance, Pearce et al. (2018)) and Bayesian ( Kendall and Gal (2017)) sides. In the Bayesian setting it was naturally proposed to promote the weights of neural layers to normally distributed random variables (MacKay (1992)). Later it was shown that the learnt uncertainty in the weights improves generalization in non-linear regression problems, and it can be applied to drive the explorationexploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning ( Blundell et al. (2015)). Depeweg et al. (2017) designed a method of separation of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric. Epistemic uncertainty expresses uncertainties inherent to the model and can not be reduced with additional observations, whereas aleatoric uncertainty captures the amount of noise due to training on a specific sample. In physics the former and latter are referred to as the systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively. In treating both types of uncertainty within the same framework authors essentially bridged the gap towards graphical models. Graphical models, unlike traditional neural networks, are probabilistic in nature and allow for incorporation of prior beliefs with respect to models. They are flexible in representing various processes and allow for introduction of latent degrees of freedom. Initially graphical models used various point distribution as building blocks, while mostly normal distribution has been promoted to a random in the notable example of Gaussian random fields. In this work we propose using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) as building blocks in graphical models and demonstrate the power of synthesis of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and BNNs on a synthetic example of signal/background separation. As a demonstration of our approach we propose the additive mixture model: a superposition of signal and background spectra whose proportion varies in space. During inference we are able to learn the proportion of signal and background and their spectral shapes that match ground truth values to adequate precision. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recapitulate the feed-forward (vanilla) BNN and the variational inference approach. In Section 3 we present the transformations of a vanilla BNN that allow to emulate various distribution fields. To illustrate the power of composition of transformed BNNs in Section 4 we introduce a model of additive BNN mixture. In Section 5 we describe our experiments and in Section 6 we discuss the results and evaluate model performance. In Section 7 we conclude by a discussion of limitations as well as prospective domains of applications of our framework. 2 BACKGROUND: VANILLA BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK: We consider feed-forward deep neural architectures that are composed of dense layers. A dense layer k is an affine transformation Lk with weightWk and bias Bk that is followed by an element-wise non-linear transformation \u03c3: hk = Lk \u25e6 hk\u22121 = \u03c3(hk\u22121Wk + Bk), also known as the activation function. In our experiments we set \u03c3 to be ReLU , defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x). In what follows we work with a simple linear deep architecture which is defined as a consecutive application (composition) of dense layers: y = LK \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7L1 \u25e6 x . In order to enable probabilistic interpretation of inference using neural networks, the weights and the biases of each layer are promoted to random variables and are sampled from a Normal distribution with corresponding parameters: Wk \u223c N(\u00b5W ,\u03a3W), Bk \u223c N(\u00b5B,\u03a3B). In Fig. 1, right panel we depict an elementary Bayesian Neural Network, composed of k layers and that takes as input x, consisting of N samples, and rendering y as output, using plate notation. We consider a simple BNN in the spirit of (Blundell et al. (2015)), where authors use stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman et al. (2013); Wingate and Weber (2013)) for Gaussian posterior distributions from prior distributions of weights, biases and observations. Under these conditions it is natural to use Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) (Mehta et al. (2019)) as the loss function. ELBO loss consists of two terms: log evidence of the observable variable x with learnable parameters \u03b8, log p\u03b8(x), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximation of the posterior distribution q\u03c6(z), parametrized by \u03c6, and the true posterior p\u03b8(z|x): ELBO = log p\u03b8(x)\u2212 KL (q\u03c6(z)||p\u03b8(z|x)) . (1) Taking steps in \u03c6 to increase ELBO, increases log evidence and decreases the distance between the prior and the posterior. We further illustrate this in Fig. 1, left. Inference results depend on the choice of the optimizer, the learning rate and the number of iterations. 3 TRANSFORMED BNNS: Non-trivial examples of probabilistic models combine distributions of various types. Consider a K-component Gaussian Mixture model: each component of the mixture is normally distributed, where the mean parameterized by real-valued parameters and the scale - by a positive parameter, while the overall proportions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Xk \u223c Dir(\u03b1), which, in turn, is parameterized by a positive vector \u03b11, . . . \u03b1K > 0, and Xk belong to a K \u2212 1 simplex: \u2211 Xk = 1. We are therefore motivated to introduce a family of transformed BNNs with various ranges. In this manuscript we consider exponential transformation (transforms unconstrained vector of K dimensions to a positive vector of K dimensions) and a stick breaking transformation (unconstrained vector of K \u2212 1 dimensions into a simplex vector of K dimensions). We propose to apply transformations after the last layer of BNN, in such a way that the range of the output is constrained to be strictly positive for the exponential transform and a k-dimensional vector summing to unity (k-simplex) for the stick breaking transformation. In what follows we denote vector y sampled from a Bayesian neural network as y \u223c BNN(x, (W,B)). We denote BNN outputs transformed by exponential and stick-breaking transforms BNNe and BNNs, respectively. Another type of BNN transformation we consider is prompted by probability distributions: in certain applications it is particularly useful to work not just with positive random fields but with normalized positive random fields. Practically such a transformation consists of an approximate normalization of the BNN output given the data. 4 ADDITIVE MIXTURE: Having introduced architectures with a single dense unit BNN, we turn to a non-trivial test of our framework: a generative additive mixture model. In this model we consider two types of coordinates: we refer to x as the spatial coordinate and p as the spectral coordinate. We consider two positive spectral functions g1(p) and g2(p) that are mixed in a spatially dependent manner by a simplex-valued \u03b2(x), and suppose that only their sum f(x, p) is observed: f(x, p) = \u03b2(x)g1(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b2(x))g2(p). (2) This model is motivated by the problem of identification of spectrum of signal g2(p) in the presence of non-trivial noise g1(p). We assume that gl(p) are normalized: \u222b dpgl(p) = 1. It follows immediately that f(x) = \u222b dp f(x, p) is equal to 1 for each x. Spectral functions gl(p) are positive-valued and we model them by an exponentially transformed BNNe. We model \u03b2(x) as a Dirichlet random field \u03b2(x) \u223c Dir(\u03b1l(x)), where \u03b1l(x) = N\u03b3l(x) and \u03b3 \u223c BNNs(x) (stick-breaking transformed BNN). In order to deal with degeneracy due to the permutation symmetry: g1 \u2194 g2 and \u03b2 \u2194 1\u2212 \u03b2 we set the initial value of \u03b3l to correspond to an asymmetric proportion. e.g (0.99, 0.01), where the first component represents the background, while the other - the signal. To further discourage the inference engine from splitting the observed signal between components uniformly we introduce another observable, the relative entropy between spectral components g1(p) and g2(p) : DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) = \u222b g2(p) ln(g2(p)/g1(p)) and set it to a large number, e.g ., 100. The first observed term forces the combination of gl(p) and \u03b2(x) to approximate yi. The term containing relative entropy forces to learn maximally different g1(p) and g2(p), since DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) is a proxy to distance in function space. The objective of the inference is to identify optimal model parameters \u03c6\u03b2 and \u03c6g and thus to obtain the full spatial and spectral description of the mixture, i .e., the shapes of gl(p) and the mixing proportion \u03b2(x). In the current formulation the additive mixture model does not include Bayesian treatment aleatoric uncertainty, observations are sampled using a small fixed variance (0.002). 5 EXPERIMENTS: BNN abstractions and experiments were implemented1 in Pyro (version 1.5.2) (Bingham et al. (2019)), a probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and based on pytorch, which enables Bayesian probabilistic modeling thanks to Monte Carlo and variational inference engines. In our experiments we use unit BNNs containing 3 hidden layers of dimensions 32\u00d7 128\u00d7 32. Inference. We use Pyro\u2019s stochastic variational inference (SVI) abstraction which computes ELBO loss and take steps in the space of \u201cguide\u201d parameters \u03c6 along the gradients of loss function. As a whole the procedure is a Bayesian update: it identifies variational parameters \u03c6 of the true posterior approximation q\u03c6(z). In what follows we use Clipped Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) (Kingma and Ba (2014)) as the optimization method and, unless mentioned otherwise, set the learning rate to 10\u22122, the clipping norm to 10, and default values for the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square: (0.9, 0.999). The value of the ELBO loss is computed for each epoch. The relative values of the loss with respect to the previous iterations is computed too. For a chosen window, the former are compared with two conditions. We improve the inference procedure in an empiric manner by restarting it with a decreasing value of learning rate (factor of 0.5 in our case), while keeping current \u201cguide\u201d parameters. The restart happens if (i) the last Sp steps resulted in an increased loss or (ii) the last Sr steps resulted in a relative loss below a certain threshold. Both Sp and Sr are chosen to be 3 in the current project. Condition (i) means that the inference engine is diverging from optimal region of the parameter space (likely due to the stochastic nature of sampling), which manifests in the divergence of loss function. This procedure is repeated until a fixed number of steps are performed. Training of unit BNNs.

To fit this positive function we use an exponentially transformed BNNe, which is sampled using log-normal distribution after the last layer by convention. The inferred posterior distribution of the inference on a unit BNN is shown in the left panel, the loss - in the second-to-left, the location parameters \u00b5 of weightsW of the last hidden layer of given BNN a function of epoch - in the second-to-right and the evolution of scale parameters \u03a3 - in the right panel of Fig. 3. The inferred posterior distribution matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model. Synthetic Additive Mixture. By considering the additive mixture model we answer the following fundamental question: if a superposition of two spectral (i .e. positive) functions is observed as a function of spatial coordinates, can we learn their shapes and proportions, given a minimum amount of information? To test our method for the additive mixture model we create a synthetic dataset containing triples D = {(xi, pi, fi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 R, pi \u2208 R, where xi and pi are sampled uniformly on [\u22125, 5] and refer to this particular implementation as the Signal/Background (SB) model. The values of f(xi, pi) are derived using the generative model of Sec. 4 with deterministic gl(p) and deterministic \u03b2(x). In what follows we refer to g1(p) and g2(p) as the background and the signal, respectively. We consider (i) case A where non-informative priors are used, and (ii) case B where only g1(p) is conditioned. For both of them we use a previously introduced template g\u2217(p) (normalized to 1), which we shifted by b = 2.5 in two directions: g1(p) = g\u2217(p\u2212 b) and g2(p) = g\u2217(p+ b). First we demonstrate that the inference works for a specific choice of \u03b2: we choose \u03b2(x) to be a logistic function with values at \u2212\u221e equal to 0.99 and +\u221e equal to 0.5. Afterwards we test the limit of our approach by considering synthetic datasets with decreasingly small proportion of \u201csignal\u201d. \u03b2(x) and gl(p) are represented by a stick-breaking and an exponentially transformed BNNs (see Sec. 4), hereafter referred as to BNN\u03b2 and BNNg, respectively. Both of them have output dimensions equal to 2. The prior distributions for (W , B) of all hidden layers of BNN\u03b2 and BNNg are taken to be \u223c N(0, 0.1). It is instructive to representBNN\u03b2(x,W,B) graphically as a function of x, whereW,B are sampled from prior distributions: in Fig. 5 the mean values are plotted as dashed lines together with the 68% containment bands as shaded areas for case A and case B in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Location parameters of theW for the last hidden layer of BNN\u03b2 as a function of epoch are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The scale parameters are shown in the middle panel of the same figure. The right panel shows the ELBO loss as a function of epoch. The top panels show the results for case A and the bottom panels for case A. For the case of non-informative prior the variation of the means is negligible after 700 epochs. In the case where the g1 is conditioned, locations hyperparameters converge to their terminal values after 500 epochs. 6 RESULTS: In what follows, we set \u03b2(x) to vary continuously from \u03b2T |x=\u22125 = 0.99 in the backgrounddominated spatial region to \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 in the mixture region. The inferred posterior distribution of 1-\u03b2(x) and gl(p) are shown in Fig. 5 for proportion in the mixture region of \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 for cases A and B in the upper and lower, left and second-to-left panels, respectively. The inferred posterior distribution for 1-\u03b2(x) matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model for cases A and B. For case B, the relative error between the true signal proportion at x = 5, i.e. 1-\u03b2T |x=5, and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 8% and the prediction of g2 is in agreement with true values within 95% confidence level. For case A, the relative error between the true signal proportion and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 9% but the ground truth values of g2 are not contained in the 95% confidence band. We also run a series of experiments by changing \u03c1 = \u03b2T (x=5) (1\u2212\u03b2T (x=5)) in the ground truth data, or, in other words, the ground truth background fraction value at the right boundary, which may be interpreted as the noise-to-signal ratio. Each experiment is repeated several times with random seeds to help us mapping the distribution. In Fig. 6, we plot the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the prediction of the corresponding constituent BNN after the SB inference and the true value of 1-\u03b2 and gl, respectively, as a function of \u03c1. We note that the variation of RMSD for g1 over the whole range of \u03c1 is small. We also note that the error in identification of g2 and 1-\u03b2 increases with increase of \u03c1, potentially due to the fact that the inference procedure is no longer able to distinguish a small signal from the fixed aleatoric noise. 7 DISCUSSION: In this work we introduced a framework that merges the powers of Bayesian neural networks and graphical models and demonstrated its validity on a proof of concept model of signal/background separation. This framework allows to compose BNNs, representing random fields, in the same way point distributions are composed in graphical models.

The paper title is: Unsupervised Non-Parametric Signal Separation Using Bayesian Neural Networks. INTRODUCTION: Neural networks as predictive models have been wildly successful across a variety of domains, be it image recognition or language modeling. And while they may be used to make predictions on previously unseen samples, one of fundamental weaknesses of traditional neural networks is the inability to quantify the prediction uncertainty. Evaluation of prediction uncertainty is important in basic research (identification of fundamental laws), reinforcement learning (identification of value functions), anomaly detection, etc. Uncertainty quantification in neural networks has been addressed both from frequentist (see, for instance, Pearce et al. (2018)) and Bayesian ( Kendall and Gal (2017)) sides. In the Bayesian setting it was naturally proposed to promote the weights of neural layers to normally distributed random variables (MacKay (1992)). Later it was shown that the learnt uncertainty in the weights improves generalization in non-linear regression problems, and it can be applied to drive the explorationexploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning ( Blundell et al. (2015)). Depeweg et al. (2017) designed a method of separation of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric. Epistemic uncertainty expresses uncertainties inherent to the model and can not be reduced with additional observations, whereas aleatoric uncertainty captures the amount of noise due to training on a specific sample. In physics the former and latter are referred to as the systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively. In treating both types of uncertainty within the same framework authors essentially bridged the gap towards graphical models. Graphical models, unlike traditional neural networks, are probabilistic in nature and allow for incorporation of prior beliefs with respect to models. They are flexible in representing various processes and allow for introduction of latent degrees of freedom. Initially graphical models used various point distribution as building blocks, while mostly normal distribution has been promoted to a random in the notable example of Gaussian random fields. In this work we propose using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) as building blocks in graphical models and demonstrate the power of synthesis of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and BNNs on a synthetic example of signal/background separation. As a demonstration of our approach we propose the additive mixture model: a superposition of signal and background spectra whose proportion varies in space. During inference we are able to learn the proportion of signal and background and their spectral shapes that match ground truth values to adequate precision. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recapitulate the feed-forward (vanilla) BNN and the variational inference approach. In Section 3 we present the transformations of a vanilla BNN that allow to emulate various distribution fields. To illustrate the power of composition of transformed BNNs in Section 4 we introduce a model of additive BNN mixture. In Section 5 we describe our experiments and in Section 6 we discuss the results and evaluate model performance. In Section 7 we conclude by a discussion of limitations as well as prospective domains of applications of our framework. 2 BACKGROUND: VANILLA BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK: We consider feed-forward deep neural architectures that are composed of dense layers. A dense layer k is an affine transformation Lk with weightWk and bias Bk that is followed by an element-wise non-linear transformation \u03c3: hk = Lk \u25e6 hk\u22121 = \u03c3(hk\u22121Wk + Bk), also known as the activation function. In our experiments we set \u03c3 to be ReLU , defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x). In what follows we work with a simple linear deep architecture which is defined as a consecutive application (composition) of dense layers: y = LK \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7L1 \u25e6 x . In order to enable probabilistic interpretation of inference using neural networks, the weights and the biases of each layer are promoted to random variables and are sampled from a Normal distribution with corresponding parameters: Wk \u223c N(\u00b5W ,\u03a3W), Bk \u223c N(\u00b5B,\u03a3B). In Fig. 1, right panel we depict an elementary Bayesian Neural Network, composed of k layers and that takes as input x, consisting of N samples, and rendering y as output, using plate notation. We consider a simple BNN in the spirit of (Blundell et al. (2015)), where authors use stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman et al. (2013); Wingate and Weber (2013)) for Gaussian posterior distributions from prior distributions of weights, biases and observations. Under these conditions it is natural to use Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) (Mehta et al. (2019)) as the loss function. ELBO loss consists of two terms: log evidence of the observable variable x with learnable parameters \u03b8, log p\u03b8(x), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximation of the posterior distribution q\u03c6(z), parametrized by \u03c6, and the true posterior p\u03b8(z|x): ELBO = log p\u03b8(x)\u2212 KL (q\u03c6(z)||p\u03b8(z|x)) . (1) Taking steps in \u03c6 to increase ELBO, increases log evidence and decreases the distance between the prior and the posterior. We further illustrate this in Fig. 1, left. Inference results depend on the choice of the optimizer, the learning rate and the number of iterations. 3 TRANSFORMED BNNS: Non-trivial examples of probabilistic models combine distributions of various types. Consider a K-component Gaussian Mixture model: each component of the mixture is normally distributed, where the mean parameterized by real-valued parameters and the scale - by a positive parameter, while the overall proportions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Xk \u223c Dir(\u03b1), which, in turn, is parameterized by a positive vector \u03b11, . . . \u03b1K > 0, and Xk belong to a K \u2212 1 simplex: \u2211 Xk = 1. We are therefore motivated to introduce a family of transformed BNNs with various ranges. In this manuscript we consider exponential transformation (transforms unconstrained vector of K dimensions to a positive vector of K dimensions) and a stick breaking transformation (unconstrained vector of K \u2212 1 dimensions into a simplex vector of K dimensions). We propose to apply transformations after the last layer of BNN, in such a way that the range of the output is constrained to be strictly positive for the exponential transform and a k-dimensional vector summing to unity (k-simplex) for the stick breaking transformation. In what follows we denote vector y sampled from a Bayesian neural network as y \u223c BNN(x, (W,B)). We denote BNN outputs transformed by exponential and stick-breaking transforms BNNe and BNNs, respectively. Another type of BNN transformation we consider is prompted by probability distributions: in certain applications it is particularly useful to work not just with positive random fields but with normalized positive random fields. Practically such a transformation consists of an approximate normalization of the BNN output given the data. 4 ADDITIVE MIXTURE: Having introduced architectures with a single dense unit BNN, we turn to a non-trivial test of our framework: a generative additive mixture model. In this model we consider two types of coordinates: we refer to x as the spatial coordinate and p as the spectral coordinate. We consider two positive spectral functions g1(p) and g2(p) that are mixed in a spatially dependent manner by a simplex-valued \u03b2(x), and suppose that only their sum f(x, p) is observed: f(x, p) = \u03b2(x)g1(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b2(x))g2(p). (2) This model is motivated by the problem of identification of spectrum of signal g2(p) in the presence of non-trivial noise g1(p). We assume that gl(p) are normalized: \u222b dpgl(p) = 1. It follows immediately that f(x) = \u222b dp f(x, p) is equal to 1 for each x. Spectral functions gl(p) are positive-valued and we model them by an exponentially transformed BNNe. We model \u03b2(x) as a Dirichlet random field \u03b2(x) \u223c Dir(\u03b1l(x)), where \u03b1l(x) = N\u03b3l(x) and \u03b3 \u223c BNNs(x) (stick-breaking transformed BNN). In order to deal with degeneracy due to the permutation symmetry: g1 \u2194 g2 and \u03b2 \u2194 1\u2212 \u03b2 we set the initial value of \u03b3l to correspond to an asymmetric proportion. e.g (0.99, 0.01), where the first component represents the background, while the other - the signal. To further discourage the inference engine from splitting the observed signal between components uniformly we introduce another observable, the relative entropy between spectral components g1(p) and g2(p) : DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) = \u222b g2(p) ln(g2(p)/g1(p)) and set it to a large number, e.g ., 100. The first observed term forces the combination of gl(p) and \u03b2(x) to approximate yi. The term containing relative entropy forces to learn maximally different g1(p) and g2(p), since DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) is a proxy to distance in function space. The objective of the inference is to identify optimal model parameters \u03c6\u03b2 and \u03c6g and thus to obtain the full spatial and spectral description of the mixture, i .e., the shapes of gl(p) and the mixing proportion \u03b2(x). In the current formulation the additive mixture model does not include Bayesian treatment aleatoric uncertainty, observations are sampled using a small fixed variance (0.002). 5 EXPERIMENTS: BNN abstractions and experiments were implemented1 in Pyro (version 1.5.2) (Bingham et al. (2019)), a probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and based on pytorch, which enables Bayesian probabilistic modeling thanks to Monte Carlo and variational inference engines. In our experiments we use unit BNNs containing 3 hidden layers of dimensions 32\u00d7 128\u00d7 32. Inference. We use Pyro\u2019s stochastic variational inference (SVI) abstraction which computes ELBO loss and take steps in the space of \u201cguide\u201d parameters \u03c6 along the gradients of loss function. As a whole the procedure is a Bayesian update: it identifies variational parameters \u03c6 of the true posterior approximation q\u03c6(z). In what follows we use Clipped Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) (Kingma and Ba (2014)) as the optimization method and, unless mentioned otherwise, set the learning rate to 10\u22122, the clipping norm to 10, and default values for the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square: (0.9, 0.999). The value of the ELBO loss is computed for each epoch. The relative values of the loss with respect to the previous iterations is computed too. For a chosen window, the former are compared with two conditions. We improve the inference procedure in an empiric manner by restarting it with a decreasing value of learning rate (factor of 0.5 in our case), while keeping current \u201cguide\u201d parameters. The restart happens if (i) the last Sp steps resulted in an increased loss or (ii) the last Sr steps resulted in a relative loss below a certain threshold. Both Sp and Sr are chosen to be 3 in the current project. Condition (i) means that the inference engine is diverging from optimal region of the parameter space (likely due to the stochastic nature of sampling), which manifests in the divergence of loss function. This procedure is repeated until a fixed number of steps are performed. Training of unit BNNs. Unit vanilla and transformed BNNs introduced in Section 3 may be used to approximate functions or as latent constituents of more complex models. When using them as latent parts of more complex models it is often advantageous to impose certain priors on their functional 1Implementation available at https://github.com/repo_url. form, e.g ., we might want to represent the prior knowledge of mixture composition, which is not directly observed. In other words latent components of a complex model can be pre-trained so that their priors condition the output to have the desired shape. If the prior and the \u201cguide\u201d have the same functional form, this procedure can be viewed as a Bayesian update. Using learned during pre-training \u201cguide\u201d parameters to initialize the \u201cguide\u201d when a given unit BNN is used as a constituent may improve convergence. In short we go through the following steps: (i) generate a data sample emulating desired shape, (ii) fit a unit BNN to the generated data sample using non-informative priors, thus obtaining \u201cguide\u201d parameters, and (iii) use inferred guide parameters as prior parameters and (optionally) as the initial \u201cguide\u201d parameters as part of a more complex model. The second step involves sampling BNN output to match observations. Since we are not interested in aleatoric component at this stage, we represent it as a constant and use normal, log-normal and Dirichlet for sampling. We illustrate the process of inference of a unit BNN on the example of approximating g?(p) \u223c e 1 1+p2 \u2212 1, shifted by b = \u22122.5 (and normalized to 1). To fit this positive function we use an exponentially transformed BNNe, which is sampled using log-normal distribution after the last layer by convention. The inferred posterior distribution of the inference on a unit BNN is shown in the left panel, the loss - in the second-to-left, the location parameters \u00b5 of weightsW of the last hidden layer of given BNN a function of epoch - in the second-to-right and the evolution of scale parameters \u03a3 - in the right panel of Fig. 3. The inferred posterior distribution matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model. Synthetic Additive Mixture. By considering the additive mixture model we answer the following fundamental question: if a superposition of two spectral (i .e. positive) functions is observed as a function of spatial coordinates, can we learn their shapes and proportions, given a minimum amount of information? To test our method for the additive mixture model we create a synthetic dataset containing triples D = {(xi, pi, fi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 R, pi \u2208 R, where xi and pi are sampled uniformly on [\u22125, 5] and refer to this particular implementation as the Signal/Background (SB) model. The values of f(xi, pi) are derived using the generative model of Sec. 4 with deterministic gl(p) and deterministic \u03b2(x). In what follows we refer to g1(p) and g2(p) as the background and the signal, respectively. We consider (i) case A where non-informative priors are used, and (ii) case B where only g1(p) is conditioned. For both of them we use a previously introduced template g\u2217(p) (normalized to 1), which we shifted by b = 2.5 in two directions: g1(p) = g\u2217(p\u2212 b) and g2(p) = g\u2217(p+ b). First we demonstrate that the inference works for a specific choice of \u03b2: we choose \u03b2(x) to be a logistic function with values at \u2212\u221e equal to 0.99 and +\u221e equal to 0.5. Afterwards we test the limit of our approach by considering synthetic datasets with decreasingly small proportion of \u201csignal\u201d. \u03b2(x) and gl(p) are represented by a stick-breaking and an exponentially transformed BNNs (see Sec. 4), hereafter referred as to BNN\u03b2 and BNNg, respectively. Both of them have output dimensions equal to 2. The prior distributions for (W , B) of all hidden layers of BNN\u03b2 and BNNg are taken to be \u223c N(0, 0.1). It is instructive to representBNN\u03b2(x,W,B) graphically as a function of x, whereW,B are sampled from prior distributions: in Fig. 5 the mean values are plotted as dashed lines together with the 68% containment bands as shaded areas for case A and case B in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Location parameters of theW for the last hidden layer of BNN\u03b2 as a function of epoch are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The scale parameters are shown in the middle panel of the same figure. The right panel shows the ELBO loss as a function of epoch. The top panels show the results for case A and the bottom panels for case A. For the case of non-informative prior the variation of the means is negligible after 700 epochs. In the case where the g1 is conditioned, locations hyperparameters converge to their terminal values after 500 epochs. 6 RESULTS: In what follows, we set \u03b2(x) to vary continuously from \u03b2T |x=\u22125 = 0.99 in the backgrounddominated spatial region to \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 in the mixture region. The inferred posterior distribution of 1-\u03b2(x) and gl(p) are shown in Fig. 5 for proportion in the mixture region of \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 for cases A and B in the upper and lower, left and second-to-left panels, respectively. The inferred posterior distribution for 1-\u03b2(x) matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model for cases A and B. For case B, the relative error between the true signal proportion at x = 5, i.e. 1-\u03b2T |x=5, and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 8% and the prediction of g2 is in agreement with true values within 95% confidence level. For case A, the relative error between the true signal proportion and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 9% but the ground truth values of g2 are not contained in the 95% confidence band. We also run a series of experiments by changing \u03c1 = \u03b2T (x=5) (1\u2212\u03b2T (x=5)) in the ground truth data, or, in other words, the ground truth background fraction value at the right boundary, which may be interpreted as the noise-to-signal ratio. Each experiment is repeated several times with random seeds to help us mapping the distribution. In Fig. 6, we plot the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the prediction of the corresponding constituent BNN after the SB inference and the true value of 1-\u03b2 and gl, respectively, as a function of \u03c1. We note that the variation of RMSD for g1 over the whole range of \u03c1 is small. We also note that the error in identification of g2 and 1-\u03b2 increases with increase of \u03c1, potentially due to the fact that the inference procedure is no longer able to distinguish a small signal from the fixed aleatoric noise. 7 DISCUSSION: In this work we introduced a framework that merges the powers of Bayesian neural networks and graphical models and demonstrated its validity on a proof of concept model of signal/background separation.

The paper title is: Unsupervised Non-Parametric Signal Separation Using Bayesian Neural Networks. INTRODUCTION: Neural networks as predictive models have been wildly successful across a variety of domains, be it image recognition or language modeling. And while they may be used to make predictions on previously unseen samples, one of fundamental weaknesses of traditional neural networks is the inability to quantify the prediction uncertainty. Evaluation of prediction uncertainty is important in basic research (identification of fundamental laws), reinforcement learning (identification of value functions), anomaly detection, etc. Uncertainty quantification in neural networks has been addressed both from frequentist (see, for instance, Pearce et al. (2018)) and Bayesian ( Kendall and Gal (2017)) sides. In the Bayesian setting it was naturally proposed to promote the weights of neural layers to normally distributed random variables (MacKay (1992)). Later it was shown that the learnt uncertainty in the weights improves generalization in non-linear regression problems, and it can be applied to drive the explorationexploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning ( Blundell et al. (2015)). Depeweg et al. (2017) designed a method of separation of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric. Epistemic uncertainty expresses uncertainties inherent to the model and can not be reduced with additional observations, whereas aleatoric uncertainty captures the amount of noise due to training on a specific sample. In physics the former and latter are referred to as the systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively. In treating both types of uncertainty within the same framework authors essentially bridged the gap towards graphical models. Graphical models, unlike traditional neural networks, are probabilistic in nature and allow for incorporation of prior beliefs with respect to models. They are flexible in representing various processes and allow for introduction of latent degrees of freedom. Initially graphical models used various point distribution as building blocks, while mostly normal distribution has been promoted to a random in the notable example of Gaussian random fields. In this work we propose using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) as building blocks in graphical models and demonstrate the power of synthesis of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and BNNs on a synthetic example of signal/background separation. As a demonstration of our approach we propose the additive mixture model: a superposition of signal and background spectra whose proportion varies in space. During inference we are able to learn the proportion of signal and background and their spectral shapes that match ground truth values to adequate precision. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recapitulate the feed-forward (vanilla) BNN and the variational inference approach. In Section 3 we present the transformations of a vanilla BNN that allow to emulate various distribution fields. To illustrate the power of composition of transformed BNNs in Section 4 we introduce a model of additive BNN mixture. In Section 5 we describe our experiments and in Section 6 we discuss the results and evaluate model performance. In Section 7 we conclude by a discussion of limitations as well as prospective domains of applications of our framework. 2 BACKGROUND: VANILLA BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK: We consider feed-forward deep neural architectures that are composed of dense layers. A dense layer k is an affine transformation Lk with weightWk and bias Bk that is followed by an element-wise non-linear transformation \u03c3: hk = Lk \u25e6 hk\u22121 = \u03c3(hk\u22121Wk + Bk), also known as the activation function. In our experiments we set \u03c3 to be ReLU , defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x). In what follows we work with a simple linear deep architecture which is defined as a consecutive application (composition) of dense layers: y = LK \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7L1 \u25e6 x . In order to enable probabilistic interpretation of inference using neural networks, the weights and the biases of each layer are promoted to random variables and are sampled from a Normal distribution with corresponding parameters: Wk \u223c N(\u00b5W ,\u03a3W), Bk \u223c N(\u00b5B,\u03a3B). In Fig. 1, right panel we depict an elementary Bayesian Neural Network, composed of k layers and that takes as input x, consisting of N samples, and rendering y as output, using plate notation. We consider a simple BNN in the spirit of (Blundell et al. (2015)), where authors use stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman et al. (2013); Wingate and Weber (2013)) for Gaussian posterior distributions from prior distributions of weights, biases and observations. Under these conditions it is natural to use Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) (Mehta et al. (2019)) as the loss function. ELBO loss consists of two terms: log evidence of the observable variable x with learnable parameters \u03b8, log p\u03b8(x), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximation of the posterior distribution q\u03c6(z), parametrized by \u03c6, and the true posterior p\u03b8(z|x): ELBO = log p\u03b8(x)\u2212 KL (q\u03c6(z)||p\u03b8(z|x)) . (1) Taking steps in \u03c6 to increase ELBO, increases log evidence and decreases the distance between the prior and the posterior. We further illustrate this in Fig. 1, left. Inference results depend on the choice of the optimizer, the learning rate and the number of iterations. 3 TRANSFORMED BNNS: Non-trivial examples of probabilistic models combine distributions of various types. Consider a K-component Gaussian Mixture model: each component of the mixture is normally distributed, where the mean parameterized by real-valued parameters and the scale - by a positive parameter, while the overall proportions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Xk \u223c Dir(\u03b1), which, in turn, is parameterized by a positive vector \u03b11, . . . \u03b1K > 0, and Xk belong to a K \u2212 1 simplex: \u2211 Xk = 1. We are therefore motivated to introduce a family of transformed BNNs with various ranges. In this manuscript we consider exponential transformation (transforms unconstrained vector of K dimensions to a positive vector of K dimensions) and a stick breaking transformation (unconstrained vector of K \u2212 1 dimensions into a simplex vector of K dimensions). We propose to apply transformations after the last layer of BNN, in such a way that the range of the output is constrained to be strictly positive for the exponential transform and a k-dimensional vector summing to unity (k-simplex) for the stick breaking transformation. In what follows we denote vector y sampled from a Bayesian neural network as y \u223c BNN(x, (W,B)). We denote BNN outputs transformed by exponential and stick-breaking transforms BNNe and BNNs, respectively. Another type of BNN transformation we consider is prompted by probability distributions: in certain applications it is particularly useful to work not just with positive random fields but with normalized positive random fields. Practically such a transformation consists of an approximate normalization of the BNN output given the data. 4 ADDITIVE MIXTURE: Having introduced architectures with a single dense unit BNN, we turn to a non-trivial test of our framework: a generative additive mixture model. In this model we consider two types of coordinates: we refer to x as the spatial coordinate and p as the spectral coordinate. We consider two positive spectral functions g1(p) and g2(p) that are mixed in a spatially dependent manner by a simplex-valued \u03b2(x), and suppose that only their sum f(x, p) is observed: f(x, p) = \u03b2(x)g1(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b2(x))g2(p). (2) This model is motivated by the problem of identification of spectrum of signal g2(p) in the presence of non-trivial noise g1(p). We assume that gl(p) are normalized: \u222b dpgl(p) = 1. It follows immediately that f(x) = \u222b dp f(x, p) is equal to 1 for each x. Spectral functions gl(p) are positive-valued and we model them by an exponentially transformed BNNe. We model \u03b2(x) as a Dirichlet random field \u03b2(x) \u223c Dir(\u03b1l(x)), where \u03b1l(x) = N\u03b3l(x) and \u03b3 \u223c BNNs(x) (stick-breaking transformed BNN). In order to deal with degeneracy due to the permutation symmetry: g1 \u2194 g2 and \u03b2 \u2194 1\u2212 \u03b2 we set the initial value of \u03b3l to correspond to an asymmetric proportion. e.g (0.99, 0.01), where the first component represents the background, while the other - the signal. To further discourage the inference engine from splitting the observed signal between components uniformly we introduce another observable, the relative entropy between spectral components g1(p) and g2(p) : DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) = \u222b g2(p) ln(g2(p)/g1(p)) and set it to a large number, e.g ., 100. The first observed term forces the combination of gl(p) and \u03b2(x) to approximate yi. The term containing relative entropy forces to learn maximally different g1(p) and g2(p), since DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) is a proxy to distance in function space. The objective of the inference is to identify optimal model parameters \u03c6\u03b2 and \u03c6g and thus to obtain the full spatial and spectral description of the mixture, i .e., the shapes of gl(p) and the mixing proportion \u03b2(x). In the current formulation the additive mixture model does not include Bayesian treatment aleatoric uncertainty, observations are sampled using a small fixed variance (0.002). 5 EXPERIMENTS: BNN abstractions and experiments were implemented1 in Pyro (version 1.5.2) (Bingham et al. (2019)), a probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and based on pytorch, which enables Bayesian probabilistic modeling thanks to Monte Carlo and variational inference engines. In our experiments we use unit BNNs containing 3 hidden layers of dimensions 32\u00d7 128\u00d7 32. Inference. We use Pyro\u2019s stochastic variational inference (SVI) abstraction which computes ELBO loss and take steps in the space of \u201cguide\u201d parameters \u03c6 along the gradients of loss function. As a whole the procedure is a Bayesian update: it identifies variational parameters \u03c6 of the true posterior approximation q\u03c6(z). In what follows we use Clipped Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) (Kingma and Ba (2014)) as the optimization method and, unless mentioned otherwise, set the learning rate to 10\u22122, the clipping norm to 10, and default values for the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square: (0.9, 0.999). The value of the ELBO loss is computed for each epoch. The relative values of the loss with respect to the previous iterations is computed too. For a chosen window, the former are compared with two conditions. We improve the inference procedure in an empiric manner by restarting it with a decreasing value of learning rate (factor of 0.5 in our case), while keeping current \u201cguide\u201d parameters. The restart happens if (i) the last Sp steps resulted in an increased loss or (ii) the last Sr steps resulted in a relative loss below a certain threshold. Both Sp and Sr are chosen to be 3 in the current project. Condition (i) means that the inference engine is diverging from optimal region of the parameter space (likely due to the stochastic nature of sampling), which manifests in the divergence of loss function. This procedure is repeated until a fixed number of steps are performed. Training of unit BNNs. Unit vanilla and transformed BNNs introduced in Section 3 may be used to approximate functions or as latent constituents of more complex models. When using them as latent parts of more complex models it is often advantageous to impose certain priors on their functional 1Implementation available at https://github.com/repo_url. form, e.g ., we might want to represent the prior knowledge of mixture composition, which is not directly observed. In other words latent components of a complex model can be pre-trained so that their priors condition the output to have the desired shape. If the prior and the \u201cguide\u201d have the same functional form, this procedure can be viewed as a Bayesian update. Using learned during pre-training \u201cguide\u201d parameters to initialize the \u201cguide\u201d when a given unit BNN is used as a constituent may improve convergence. In short we go through the following steps: (i) generate a data sample emulating desired shape, (ii) fit a unit BNN to the generated data sample using non-informative priors, thus obtaining \u201cguide\u201d parameters, and (iii) use inferred guide parameters as prior parameters and (optionally) as the initial \u201cguide\u201d parameters as part of a more complex model. The second step involves sampling BNN output to match observations. Since we are not interested in aleatoric component at this stage, we represent it as a constant and use normal, log-normal and Dirichlet for sampling. We illustrate the process of inference of a unit BNN on the example of approximating g?(p) \u223c e 1 1+p2 \u2212 1, shifted by b = \u22122.5 (and normalized to 1). To fit this positive function we use an exponentially transformed BNNe, which is sampled using log-normal distribution after the last layer by convention. The inferred posterior distribution of the inference on a unit BNN is shown in the left panel, the loss - in the second-to-left, the location parameters \u00b5 of weightsW of the last hidden layer of given BNN a function of epoch - in the second-to-right and the evolution of scale parameters \u03a3 - in the right panel of Fig. 3. The inferred posterior distribution matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model. Synthetic Additive Mixture. By considering the additive mixture model we answer the following fundamental question: if a superposition of two spectral (i .e. positive) functions is observed as a function of spatial coordinates, can we learn their shapes and proportions, given a minimum amount of information? To test our method for the additive mixture model we create a synthetic dataset containing triples D = {(xi, pi, fi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 R, pi \u2208 R, where xi and pi are sampled uniformly on [\u22125, 5] and refer to this particular implementation as the Signal/Background (SB) model. The values of f(xi, pi) are derived using the generative model of Sec. 4 with deterministic gl(p) and deterministic \u03b2(x). In what follows we refer to g1(p) and g2(p) as the background and the signal, respectively. We consider (i) case A where non-informative priors are used, and (ii) case B where only g1(p) is conditioned. For both of them we use a previously introduced template g\u2217(p) (normalized to 1), which we shifted by b = 2.5 in two directions: g1(p) = g\u2217(p\u2212 b) and g2(p) = g\u2217(p+ b). First we demonstrate that the inference works for a specific choice of \u03b2: we choose \u03b2(x) to be a logistic function with values at \u2212\u221e equal to 0.99 and +\u221e equal to 0.5. Afterwards we test the limit of our approach by considering synthetic datasets with decreasingly small proportion of \u201csignal\u201d. \u03b2(x) and gl(p) are represented by a stick-breaking and an exponentially transformed BNNs (see Sec. 4), hereafter referred as to BNN\u03b2 and BNNg, respectively. Both of them have output dimensions equal to 2. The prior distributions for (W , B) of all hidden layers of BNN\u03b2 and BNNg are taken to be \u223c N(0, 0.1). It is instructive to representBNN\u03b2(x,W,B) graphically as a function of x, whereW,B are sampled from prior distributions: in Fig. 5 the mean values are plotted as dashed lines together with the 68% containment bands as shaded areas for case A and case B in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Location parameters of theW for the last hidden layer of BNN\u03b2 as a function of epoch are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The scale parameters are shown in the middle panel of the same figure. The right panel shows the ELBO loss as a function of epoch. The top panels show the results for case A and the bottom panels for case A. For the case of non-informative prior the variation of the means is negligible after 700 epochs. In the case where the g1 is conditioned, locations hyperparameters converge to their terminal values after 500 epochs. 6 RESULTS: In what follows, we set \u03b2(x) to vary continuously from \u03b2T |x=\u22125 = 0.99 in the backgrounddominated spatial region to \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 in the mixture region. The inferred posterior distribution of 1-\u03b2(x) and gl(p) are shown in Fig. 5 for proportion in the mixture region of \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 for cases A and B in the upper and lower, left and second-to-left panels, respectively. The inferred posterior distribution for 1-\u03b2(x) matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model for cases A and B. For case B, the relative error between the true signal proportion at x = 5, i.e. 1-\u03b2T |x=5, and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 8% and the prediction of g2 is in agreement with true values within 95% confidence level. For case A, the relative error between the true signal proportion and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 9% but the ground truth values of g2 are not contained in the 95% confidence band. We also run a series of experiments by changing \u03c1 = \u03b2T (x=5) (1\u2212\u03b2T (x=5)) in the ground truth data, or, in other words, the ground truth background fraction value at the right boundary, which may be interpreted as the noise-to-signal ratio. Each experiment is repeated several times with random seeds to help us mapping the distribution. In Fig. 6, we plot the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the prediction of the corresponding constituent BNN after the SB inference and the true value of 1-\u03b2 and gl, respectively, as a function of \u03c1. We note that the variation of RMSD for g1 over the whole range of \u03c1 is small. We also note that the error in identification of g2 and 1-\u03b2 increases with increase of \u03c1, potentially due to the fact that the inference procedure is no longer able to distinguish a small signal from the fixed aleatoric noise. 7 DISCUSSION: In this work we introduced a framework that merges the powers of Bayesian neural networks and graphical models and demonstrated its validity on a proof of concept model of signal/background separation. This framework allows to compose BNNs, representing random fields, in the same way point distributions are composed in graphical models. Our proof of concept model is motivated by the astrophysical problem of learning of an unknown signal in the presence of a potentially unknown background, which manifests at various wavelengths. We lift this traditionally treated by parametric statistical methods and more recently using Bayesian statistics (see, for instance, Abdallah et al. (2016; 2018; 2020); Abdalla et al. (2021)) problem, thanks to the power of neural networks, to a new level of non-parametric inference. Our approach is non-parametric with respect to proportions and spectral shapes and also Bayesian; it allows for Bayesian updates: to incorporate available extra information and to aggregate spectral descriptions by class (study sources that we believe belong to the same class). We outline several possible improvements and generalizations that will be addressed in future work. \u2022 At the heart of our framework of representing random fields by BNNs is a non-linear transformation of a neural network layer, that renders the output positive. According to Jensen inequality increasing the scales parametrizing a BNN will lead to a greater expectation value of the output (as well as hidden layers). This might lead to a potential problem during inference using ELBO loss, where matching expected values (of potentially latent random variables) might be achieved by increasing the scale parameter, instead of increasing the location parameter, at the same time rendering log probabilities for the sampled distribution irrelevant (as in any data fits equally well a very wide Gaussian). \u2022 From the point of view of physical modeling of signal/background separation, our model is built upon several simplifications: it does not include an explicit model of the measurement, nor does it contain a microscopic emission model. It also posits space-energy factorization, that energy-spectra are spatially independent, which is not the case if the target (gas, radiation) density fields are strongly spatially-dependent. The gamma-ray signal expected from cosmic ray interaction in the interstellar medium would therefore exhibit a spatially-dependent spectral behavior. All the above points maybe address within the current framework. \u2022 In SB model we considered the separation of total signal into two components in one spatial dimension. In astrophysics and cosmology raw observations are made in two spatial coordinates and time. Our framework allows very easily to extend the number of spatial dimensions. Increasing the number of components on the hand should be done with caution as it decreases the stability of inference due to appearance of extra permutation symmetries. \u2022 The additive mixture example was focused on identification of epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty may be represented as a parameter or another unit BNN. \u2022 SB model was demonstrated to apply in a limited signal-to-noise ratio region. While this might be due to our choice of fixed aleatoric scale, it is possible that inference using ELBO loss becomes less stable, when smaller scales are chosen. SB model may be directly applied in gamma-ray, cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational astrophysics. The framework, however, is far more general and could be used, in the context of Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), where the total household consumption signal is disaggregated into multiple house appliances and over-fitting problem is of particular importance (Jones et al. (2020)). Other applications include Bayesian modeling of value function in reinforcement learning (Eriksson et al. (2020)) and audio source separation (Schulze-Forster et al.

A dense layer k is an affine transformation Lk with weightWk and bias Bk that is followed by an element-wise non-linear transformation \u03c3: hk = Lk \u25e6 hk\u22121 = \u03c3(hk\u22121Wk + Bk), also known as the activation function.

(1) Taking steps in \u03c6 to increase ELBO, increases log evidence and decreases the distance between the prior and the posterior. We further illustrate this in Fig. 1, left. Inference results depend on the choice of the optimizer, the learning rate and the number of iterations. 3 TRANSFORMED BNNS: Non-trivial examples of probabilistic models combine distributions of various types. Consider a K-component Gaussian Mixture model: each component of the mixture is normally distributed, where the mean parameterized by real-valued parameters and the scale - by a positive parameter, while the overall proportions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Xk \u223c Dir(\u03b1), which, in turn, is parameterized by a positive vector \u03b11, . . . \u03b1K > 0, and Xk belong to a K \u2212 1 simplex: \u2211 Xk = 1. We are therefore motivated to introduce a family of transformed BNNs with various ranges. In this manuscript we consider exponential transformation (transforms unconstrained vector of K dimensions to a positive vector of K dimensions) and a stick breaking transformation (unconstrained vector of K \u2212 1 dimensions into a simplex vector of K dimensions). We propose to apply transformations after the last layer of BNN, in such a way that the range of the output is constrained to be strictly positive for the exponential transform and a k-dimensional vector summing to unity (k-simplex) for the stick breaking transformation. In what follows we denote vector y sampled from a Bayesian neural network as y \u223c BNN(x, (W,B)). We denote BNN outputs transformed by exponential and stick-breaking transforms BNNe and BNNs, respectively. Another type of BNN transformation we consider is prompted by probability distributions: in certain applications it is particularly useful to work not just with positive random fields but with normalized positive random fields. Practically such a transformation consists of an approximate normalization of the BNN output given the data. 4 ADDITIVE MIXTURE: Having introduced architectures with a single dense unit BNN, we turn to a non-trivial test of our framework: a generative additive mixture model. In this model we consider two types of coordinates: we refer to x as the spatial coordinate and p as the spectral coordinate. We consider two positive spectral functions g1(p) and g2(p) that are mixed in a spatially dependent manner by a simplex-valued \u03b2(x), and suppose that only their sum f(x, p) is observed: f(x, p) = \u03b2(x)g1(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b2(x))g2(p). (2) This model is motivated by the problem of identification of spectrum of signal g2(p) in the presence of non-trivial noise g1(p). We assume that gl(p) are normalized: \u222b dpgl(p) = 1. It follows immediately that f(x) = \u222b dp f(x, p) is equal to 1 for each x. Spectral functions gl(p) are positive-valued and we model them by an exponentially transformed BNNe. We model \u03b2(x) as a Dirichlet random field \u03b2(x) \u223c Dir(\u03b1l(x)), where \u03b1l(x) = N\u03b3l(x) and \u03b3 \u223c BNNs(x) (stick-breaking transformed BNN). In order to deal with degeneracy due to the permutation symmetry: g1 \u2194 g2 and \u03b2 \u2194 1\u2212 \u03b2 we set the initial value of \u03b3l to correspond to an asymmetric proportion. e.g (0.99, 0.01), where the first component represents the background, while the other - the signal. To further discourage the inference engine from splitting the observed signal between components uniformly we introduce another observable, the relative entropy between spectral components g1(p) and g2(p) : DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) = \u222b g2(p) ln(g2(p)/g1(p)) and set it to a large number, e.g ., 100. The first observed term forces the combination of gl(p) and \u03b2(x) to approximate yi. The term containing relative entropy forces to learn maximally different g1(p) and g2(p), since DKL(g2(p) \u2016 g1(p)) is a proxy to distance in function space. The objective of the inference is to identify optimal model parameters \u03c6\u03b2 and \u03c6g and thus to obtain the full spatial and spectral description of the mixture, i .e., the shapes of gl(p) and the mixing proportion \u03b2(x). In the current formulation the additive mixture model does not include Bayesian treatment aleatoric uncertainty, observations are sampled using a small fixed variance (0.002). 5 EXPERIMENTS: BNN abstractions and experiments were implemented1 in Pyro (version 1.5.2) (Bingham et al. (2019)), a probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and based on pytorch, which enables Bayesian probabilistic modeling thanks to Monte Carlo and variational inference engines. In our experiments we use unit BNNs containing 3 hidden layers of dimensions 32\u00d7 128\u00d7 32. Inference. We use Pyro\u2019s stochastic variational inference (SVI) abstraction which computes ELBO loss and take steps in the space of \u201cguide\u201d parameters \u03c6 along the gradients of loss function. As a whole the procedure is a Bayesian update: it identifies variational parameters \u03c6 of the true posterior approximation q\u03c6(z). In what follows we use Clipped Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) (Kingma and Ba (2014)) as the optimization method and, unless mentioned otherwise, set the learning rate to 10\u22122, the clipping norm to 10, and default values for the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square: (0.9, 0.999). The value of the ELBO loss is computed for each epoch. The relative values of the loss with respect to the previous iterations is computed too. For a chosen window, the former are compared with two conditions. We improve the inference procedure in an empiric manner by restarting it with a decreasing value of learning rate (factor of 0.5 in our case), while keeping current \u201cguide\u201d parameters. The restart happens if (i) the last Sp steps resulted in an increased loss or (ii) the last Sr steps resulted in a relative loss below a certain threshold. Both Sp and Sr are chosen to be 3 in the current project. Condition (i) means that the inference engine is diverging from optimal region of the parameter space (likely due to the stochastic nature of sampling), which manifests in the divergence of loss function. This procedure is repeated until a fixed number of steps are performed. Training of unit BNNs. Unit vanilla and transformed BNNs introduced in Section 3 may be used to approximate functions or as latent constituents of more complex models. When using them as latent parts of more complex models it is often advantageous to impose certain priors on their functional 1Implementation available at https://github.com/repo_url. form, e.g ., we might want to represent the prior knowledge of mixture composition, which is not directly observed. In other words latent components of a complex model can be pre-trained so that their priors condition the output to have the desired shape. If the prior and the \u201cguide\u201d have the same functional form, this procedure can be viewed as a Bayesian update. Using learned during pre-training \u201cguide\u201d parameters to initialize the \u201cguide\u201d when a given unit BNN is used as a constituent may improve convergence. In short we go through the following steps: (i) generate a data sample emulating desired shape, (ii) fit a unit BNN to the generated data sample using non-informative priors, thus obtaining \u201cguide\u201d parameters, and (iii) use inferred guide parameters as prior parameters and (optionally) as the initial \u201cguide\u201d parameters as part of a more complex model. The second step involves sampling BNN output to match observations. Since we are not interested in aleatoric component at this stage, we represent it as a constant and use normal, log-normal and Dirichlet for sampling. We illustrate the process of inference of a unit BNN on the example of approximating g?(p) \u223c e 1 1+p2 \u2212 1, shifted by b = \u22122.5 (and normalized to 1). To fit this positive function we use an exponentially transformed BNNe, which is sampled using log-normal distribution after the last layer by convention. The inferred posterior distribution of the inference on a unit BNN is shown in the left panel, the loss - in the second-to-left, the location parameters \u00b5 of weightsW of the last hidden layer of given BNN a function of epoch - in the second-to-right and the evolution of scale parameters \u03a3 - in the right panel of Fig. 3. The inferred posterior distribution matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model. Synthetic Additive Mixture. By considering the additive mixture model we answer the following fundamental question: if a superposition of two spectral (i .e. positive) functions is observed as a function of spatial coordinates, can we learn their shapes and proportions, given a minimum amount of information? To test our method for the additive mixture model we create a synthetic dataset containing triples D = {(xi, pi, fi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 R, pi \u2208 R, where xi and pi are sampled uniformly on [\u22125, 5] and refer to this particular implementation as the Signal/Background (SB) model. The values of f(xi, pi) are derived using the generative model of Sec. 4 with deterministic gl(p) and deterministic \u03b2(x). In what follows we refer to g1(p) and g2(p) as the background and the signal, respectively. We consider (i) case A where non-informative priors are used, and (ii) case B where only g1(p) is conditioned. For both of them we use a previously introduced template g\u2217(p) (normalized to 1), which we shifted by b = 2.5 in two directions: g1(p) = g\u2217(p\u2212 b) and g2(p) = g\u2217(p+ b). First we demonstrate that the inference works for a specific choice of \u03b2: we choose \u03b2(x) to be a logistic function with values at \u2212\u221e equal to 0.99 and +\u221e equal to 0.5. Afterwards we test the limit of our approach by considering synthetic datasets with decreasingly small proportion of \u201csignal\u201d. \u03b2(x) and gl(p) are represented by a stick-breaking and an exponentially transformed BNNs (see Sec. 4), hereafter referred as to BNN\u03b2 and BNNg, respectively. Both of them have output dimensions equal to 2. The prior distributions for (W , B) of all hidden layers of BNN\u03b2 and BNNg are taken to be \u223c N(0, 0.1). It is instructive to representBNN\u03b2(x,W,B) graphically as a function of x, whereW,B are sampled from prior distributions: in Fig. 5 the mean values are plotted as dashed lines together with the 68% containment bands as shaded areas for case A and case B in the top and bottom panel, respectively. Location parameters of theW for the last hidden layer of BNN\u03b2 as a function of epoch are shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. The scale parameters are shown in the middle panel of the same figure. The right panel shows the ELBO loss as a function of epoch. The top panels show the results for case A and the bottom panels for case A. For the case of non-informative prior the variation of the means is negligible after 700 epochs. In the case where the g1 is conditioned, locations hyperparameters converge to their terminal values after 500 epochs. 6 RESULTS: In what follows, we set \u03b2(x) to vary continuously from \u03b2T |x=\u22125 = 0.99 in the backgrounddominated spatial region to \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 in the mixture region. The inferred posterior distribution of 1-\u03b2(x) and gl(p) are shown in Fig. 5 for proportion in the mixture region of \u03b2T |x=5 = 0.7 for cases A and B in the upper and lower, left and second-to-left panels, respectively. The inferred posterior distribution for 1-\u03b2(x) matches well the true values within the 68% containment bands of the model for cases A and B. For case B, the relative error between the true signal proportion at x = 5, i.e. 1-\u03b2T |x=5, and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 8% and the prediction of g2 is in agreement with true values within 95% confidence level. For case A, the relative error between the true signal proportion and the mean proportion recovered by the model is lower than 9% but the ground truth values of g2 are not contained in the 95% confidence band. We also run a series of experiments by changing \u03c1 = \u03b2T (x=5) (1\u2212\u03b2T (x=5)) in the ground truth data, or, in other words, the ground truth background fraction value at the right boundary, which may be interpreted as the noise-to-signal ratio. Each experiment is repeated several times with random seeds to help us mapping the distribution. In Fig. 6, we plot the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the prediction of the corresponding constituent BNN after the SB inference and the true value of 1-\u03b2 and gl, respectively, as a function of \u03c1. We note that the variation of RMSD for g1 over the whole range of \u03c1 is small. We also note that the error in identification of g2 and 1-\u03b2 increases with increase of \u03c1, potentially due to the fact that the inference procedure is no longer able to distinguish a small signal from the fixed aleatoric noise. 7 DISCUSSION: In this work we introduced a framework that merges the powers of Bayesian neural networks and graphical models and demonstrated its validity on a proof of concept model of signal/background separation. This framework allows to compose BNNs, representing random fields, in the same way point distributions are composed in graphical models. Our proof of concept model is motivated by the astrophysical problem of learning of an unknown signal in the presence of a potentially unknown background, which manifests at various wavelengths. We lift this traditionally treated by parametric statistical methods and more recently using Bayesian statistics (see, for instance, Abdallah et al. (2016; 2018; 2020); Abdalla et al. (2021)) problem, thanks to the power of neural networks, to a new level of non-parametric inference. Our approach is non-parametric with respect to proportions and spectral shapes and also Bayesian; it allows for Bayesian updates: to incorporate available extra information and to aggregate spectral descriptions by class (study sources that we believe belong to the same class). We outline several possible improvements and generalizations that will be addressed in future work. \u2022 At the heart of our framework of representing random fields by BNNs is a non-linear transformation of a neural network layer, that renders the output positive. According to Jensen inequality increasing the scales parametrizing a BNN will lead to a greater expectation value of the output (as well as hidden layers). This might lead to a potential problem during inference using ELBO loss, where matching expected values (of potentially latent random variables) might be achieved by increasing the scale parameter, instead of increasing the location parameter, at the same time rendering log probabilities for the sampled distribution irrelevant (as in any data fits equally well a very wide Gaussian). \u2022 From the point of view of physical modeling of signal/background separation, our model is built upon several simplifications: it does not include an explicit model of the measurement, nor does it contain a microscopic emission model. It also posits space-energy factorization, that energy-spectra are spatially independent, which is not the case if the target (gas, radiation) density fields are strongly spatially-dependent. The gamma-ray signal expected from cosmic ray interaction in the interstellar medium would therefore exhibit a spatially-dependent spectral behavior. All the above points maybe address within the current framework. \u2022 In SB model we considered the separation of total signal into two components in one spatial dimension. In astrophysics and cosmology raw observations are made in two spatial coordinates and time. Our framework allows very easily to extend the number of spatial dimensions. Increasing the number of components on the hand should be done with caution as it decreases the stability of inference due to appearance of extra permutation symmetries. \u2022 The additive mixture example was focused on identification of epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty may be represented as a parameter or another unit BNN. \u2022 SB model was demonstrated to apply in a limited signal-to-noise ratio region. While this might be due to our choice of fixed aleatoric scale, it is possible that inference using ELBO loss becomes less stable, when smaller scales are chosen. SB model may be directly applied in gamma-ray, cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational astrophysics. The framework, however, is far more general and could be used, in the context of Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), where the total household consumption signal is disaggregated into multiple house appliances and over-fitting problem is of particular importance (Jones et al. (2020)). Other applications include Bayesian modeling of value function in reinforcement learning (Eriksson et al. (2020)) and audio source separation (Schulze-Forster et al. (2022)).Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line.\",\n  \"agent_name\": \"ApplicationReviewer\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
