The paper title is: Stochastic No-regret Learning for General Games with Variance Reduction\n\nAbstract: We show that a stochastic version of optimistic mirror descent (OMD), a variant of mirror descent with recency bias, converges fast in general games. More specifically, with our algorithm, the individual regret of each player vanishes at a speed of O(1/T 3/4) and the sum of all players\u2019 regret vanishes at a speed of O(1/T ), which is an improvement upon the O(1/ \u221a T ) convergence rate of prior stochastic algorithms, where T is the number of interaction rounds. Due to the advantage of stochastic methods in the computational cost, we significantly improve the time complexity over the deterministic algorithms to approximate coarse correlated equilibrium. To achieve lower time complexity, we equip the stochastic version of OMD in (AM21) with a novel low-variance MonteCarlo estimator. Our algorithm extends previous works (AM21; CJST19) from two-player zero-sum games to general games. 1 INTRODUCTION: How does a player in a game interact with others, and selfishly maximize its own utilities? This is one central problem in online learning and game theory and has intimate connections to economics, auction design, and machine learning. The study of this problem was pioneered by (Bro49; Rob51). Robinson (Rob51) shows that fictitious play asymptotically converges to Nash equilibrium in twoplayer zero-sum games. But its convergence rate is exponentially slow and it may not even converge in non-zero-sum games (Sha64). Another natural choice for each player is to use no-regret learning algorithms. With some well-known families of no-regret learning algorithms, e.g., mirror descent (NY83) and follow-the-regularizedleader (KV05), the average regret of each player vanishes at a speed of O(1/ \u221a T ) where T is the number of interaction rounds. This regret bound implies an O(1/ \u221a T ) convergence rate to the coarse correlated equilibrium in general games (or Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games). And it is noteworthy that Chen and Peng (CP20) show that these algorithms\u2019 convergence rate is \u2126(1/ \u221a T ). Players can do even better with some special no-regret algorithms tailored for games. The most representative one is known as optimistic mirror descent (OMD) which is a variant of mirror descent with recency bias. Syrgkanis et al. (SALS15) and Rakhlin et al. (RS13) show that OMD approaches optimal social welfare (or equivalently, minimizes the sum of all players\u2019 regrets) at a speed of O(1/T ) and minimizes each player\u2019s individual regret at a speed of O(1/T 3/4). Several works (CP20; HAM21; DFG21) improve the results in (SALS15) under different settings or assumptions. Remarkably, Daskalakis et al. (DFG21) improve the convergence rate of players\u2019 individual regret of OMD to O(poly log T/T ) in general games. However, the computational cost of players to use OMD, as well as other deterministic no-regret algorithms, could be not manageable. This is because each player needs to compute the exact loss vector to update its strategy in OMD. And the time complexity of computing this exact loss vector is, in the worst case, exponential in the number of players in the game. One standard method to accelerate the computation is to estimate the loss vector with Monte-Carlo methods. But a MonteCarlo estimator with uncontrolled variance will immediately make the convergence rate degenerate to O(1/ \u221a T ). To alleviate the effect of Monte-Carlo estimator\u2019s variance, Carmon et al. (CJST19) and Alacaoglu et al. (AM21) propose variance reduced stochastic no-regret algorithms with convergence rate of O(1/T ) for two-player zero-sum games. As a result, they improve the time complexity of computing \u03f5-Nash Equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games from O(Cost/\u03f5) of deterministic algorithms to O(Cost + \u221a Cost/\u03f5) (some lower order terms are omitted) where Cost is the time complexity of computing the loss vector. While Carmon et al. (CJST19) and Alacaoglu et al. (AM21) make a huge step towards developing efficient stochastic algorithms for games, their algorithms are tailored for the simplest two-player zero-sum games and could not cover more practical settings, such as auction, which may involve multiple players and not be zero-sum. One crucial factor of the algorithms in Carmon et al. (CJST19) and Alacaoglu et al. (AM21) is a stochastic loss estimator with small variance. However, the time complexity of calculating this estimator is O(AN\u22121) where N is the number of players, which is exponentially large in general games. The high complexity of the estimator becomes a major obstacle to develop efficient stochastic algorithms for general games. Contributions. We consider general normal-form games with an arbitrary number of players. Compared to the two-player zero-sum case, this is more challenging and practically significant. We show that in general games, a stochastic version of OMD converges to the optimal social welfare (or equivalently, minimizes the sum of all players\u2019 regrets) at a rate of O\u0303(1/T ) and minimizes the individual regret at a speed of O(1/T 3/4) in contrast to the O(1/ \u221a T ) convergence rate of existing stochastic algorithms. Due to the advantage of stochastic methods in the computational cost, this significantly improves the time-complexity to approximate coarse correlated equilibrium in general games. Please see Table 1 for the comparison of the time complexity of our algorithm against prior works. To achieve the above regret bounds, we make two main technical contributions. Firstly, we extend the theoretical framework of analyzing regret bounds of stochastic OMD in (AM21) from two-player zero-sum games to general games. Secondly, we propose a novel low-variance Monte-Carlo estimator for general games. The computational complexity of this estimator is exponentially faster than Carmon et al. (CJST19) and Alacaoglu et al. (AM21) while the variance is only slightly larger. The stochastic OMD algorithm equipped with our novel estimator achieves the above results. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss prior works related to this problem. In Section 3, we provide necessary preliminaries for games, coarse correlated equilibrium and optimistic mirror descent. In Section 4, we introduce our algorithm and present a general regret upper bound in Theorem 1. In Section 5, we introduce our low-variance Monte-Carlo estimator and analyze its variance in Lemma 3. In Section 6, by combining the results in Theorem 1 and Lemma 3, we present our final regret bounds in Theorem 2 and 3, as well as the time complexity to approximate coarse correlated equilibrium in Corollary 1 and 2. 2 RELATED WORK: Comparisons to existing algorithms. Table 1 compares the time complexity of our algorithm to compute \u03f5-coarse correlated equilibrium for general games (and \u03f5-Nash equilibrium for two-player zero-sum games) against prior no-regret algorithms. The time complexity is determined by two terms: the convergence rate (or the regret) and the computational cost in each round. Deterministic algorithms (PSS21; DFG21; SALS15) converge fast, but with a relatively higher per round time complexity since they have to compute the loss in each round. Stochastic algorithms exploit the Monte-Carlo approach to accelerate the computation of loss. However, the variance of the estimated loss may slow down the convergence rate. To alleviate the effect of the variance, Carmon et al. (CJST19) and Alacaoglu et al. (AM21) develop variance reduced stochastic no-regret learning algorithms. Their algorithms significantly accelerate the computation of \u03f5-Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games. Variance reduction. Variance reduction is one of the most useful techniques to accelerate stochastic algorithm (see (GSBR20) for a comprehensive survey). Typically, when optimizing the finite sum problem minx F (x) = \u2211N i=1 Fi(x), instead of estimating the gradient by \u2207Fi(x) like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the variance reduction method proposes to use \u2207\u0303F (x) = \u2207F (wk) + \u2207Fi(x)\u2212\u2207Fi(wk), where wk is called the \u201csnapshot\". In many cases, e.g., when Fi\u2019s are convex, sampling i from a uniform distribution is sufficient to reduce the variance. When dealing with games, it turns out that one has to be meticulous to design a low-variance sampling distribution, even when the game is two-player zero-sum (CJST19; AM21). And it remains unclear how to design such a low-variance distribution for general games. One of our main contributions is a low-variance Monte-Carlo estimator for general games, which ensures the fast convergence in general games. Stochastic no-regret learning for large-scale sequential decision-making. Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) (ZJBP07) generalizes no regret learning to games with sequential decisionmaking, namely extensive-form games. A long list of works study the variants of CFR (LWZB09; BS19a; ZRL+19; MSB+17; TBJB15). And these works lead to the superhuman AI, Libratus (BS18) and Pluribus (BS19b), for two-player and six-player heads-up no-limit Texas Hold\u2019em (HUNL). Since the state space of HUNL is super huge, both Libratus and Pluribus adopt the Monte-Carlo CFR with external sampling (LWZB09). And the experimental results suggest that the variance of MonteCarlo sampling significantly slows down the convergence rate. Several works empirically reduce the variance of Monte-Carlo sampling (SBL+19; BS19b). However, to the best of our knowledge, these algorithms do not enjoy any theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate. We hope our algorithms could provide insights into the developing of low-variance stochastic algorithms for large-scale games. 3 PRELIMINARY: Notation. For any vector v \u2208 Rd, denote v(j) as its jth coordinate, \u2225v\u22251 = \u2211d j=1 |v(j)| as its \u21131-norm, \u2225v\u22252 = \u221a\u2211d j=1 v 2(j) as its \u21132-norm, and \u2225v\u2225\u221e = maxj=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,d |v(j)| as its \u2113\u221e norm. For a general norm \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225, let \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u2217 represent its dual norm. Denote \u27e8v, w\u27e9 = \u2211d i=1 v(i)w(i) as the standard inner product of two vectors v, w \u2208 Rd. For a positive integer n, let [n] = {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n}. For a discrete set S, let \u2206(S) be the set of distributions over S. Basics of game. We consider general games with N players. The action space of each player i \u2208 [N ] is Ai. Denote A = maxi|Ai| as the cardinality of the largest action space. The joint action space of all players is A = A1\u00d7A2\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7AN . For simplicity, let A\u2212i = A1\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7Ai\u22121\u00d7Ai+1\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7AN be the joint action space of all players except for player i \u2208 [N ]. The loss of players can be specified by the functions F1, F2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , FN : A \u2192 [0, 1], which map the joint action space to a real value. Specifically, if each player j selects action aj \u2208 Aj , then Fi(a) is the loss of player i where a := (a1, a2, . . . , aN ). A mixed strategy \u03c3i is a probability distribution over Ai. We say a player pi plays according to \u03c3i if it selects action ai \u2208 Ai with probability \u03c3i(ai). For any strategy profile \u03c3 := (\u03c3i)i\u2208[N ], let \u03c3\u2212i := (\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3i\u22121, \u03c3i+1, . . . , \u03c3N ) denote the strategy profile \u03c3 after removing \u03c3i. And for convenience, let (\u03c3\u2032i, \u03c3\u2212i) denote the strategy profile \u03c3 after replacing \u03c3i with \u03c3 \u2032 i. Similarly, given an action profile a := (ai)i\u2208[N ], let a\u2212i := (a1, . . . , ai\u22121, ai+1, . . . , aN ) denote the action profile after removing ai and (a\u2032i, a\u2212i) be the action profile a after replacing ai with a \u2032 i. With a little abuse of notation, for a strategy profile \u03c3, let Fi(\u03c3) := Ea\u223c\u03c3 [ Fi(a) ] be the expected loss of player i if each player j \u2208 [N ] plays according to \u03c3j . For convenience, define the vector Fi(a\u2212i) \u2208 [0, 1]|Ai| with [Fi(a\u2212i)](a\u2032i) = Fi((a\u2032i, a\u2212i)) representing the loss of player i when each player j \u0338= i selects aj and i selects a\u2032i \u2208 Ai. Similarly, define the vector Fi(\u03c3\u2212i) \u2208 [0, 1]|Ai| with [Fi(\u03c3\u2212i)](a\u2032i) = Ea\u2212i\u223c\u03c3\u2212i [ Fi((a \u2032 i, a\u2212i)) ] representing the expected loss of player i if each player j plays according to \u03c3j and i selects action a\u2032i. Further, denote Cost as the time complexity of computing the vector Fi(\u03c3\u2212i). No-regret learning. In online learning, N players play the game for T rounds. In round k \u2208 [T ], player i plays according to the strategy \u03c3ki and suffers the expected loss \u27e8Fi(\u03c3k\u2212i), \u03c3ki \u27e9. Each player aims to minimize its cumulative loss, which is equivalent to minimizing its regret max\u03c3i Ri(\u03c3i) := max\u03c3i \u2211T k=1\u27e8Fi(\u03c3k\u2212i), \u03c3ki \u2212\u03c3i\u27e9 where Ri(\u03c3i) is the cumulative loss difference between the adopted strategies and the fixed strategy \u03c3i. Given the strategy at round 1, ..., k, the optimistic mirror descent (OMD) (RS13; SALS15) method calculates the strategy in round k + 1 as: \u03c3k+1i = argmin \u03c3i\u2208\u2206(Ai) D(\u03c3i, \u03c3 k i \u2212 \u03c4(2Fi(\u03c3k\u2212i)\u2212 Fi(\u03c3k\u22121\u2212i ))) . (1) where \u03c4 is the step size and D(x, y) is the Bregman divergence induced by some mirror map h(\u00b7) 1. Without loss of generality, we mainly consider two common mirror maps in this paper: negative entropy h1(x) = \u2211d a=1 x(a) log x(a) and squared \u21132-norm h2(x) = \u2211d a=1 x 2(a). Their corresponding Bregman divergences are D1(x, y) = \u2211d a=1 x(a) log(x(a)/y(a)) and D2(x, y) =\u2211d a=1(x(a)\u2212 y(a))2, respectively. Our analyses apply to other mirror maps as well. Coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE). A correlated strategy \u03b6 is a distribution over the joint action space A. We call \u03b6 a coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) if no player can benefit from unilaterally deviating from \u03b6 given that others take actions according to \u03b6. There are two versions of approximate CCE: one corresponds to the social welfare and is referred to as weak \u03f5-CCE; the other corresponds to the individual loss and is referred to as strong \u03f5-CCE. Intuitively, weak \u03f5-CCE states that the averaged difference among all players i \u2208 [N ] between the expected loss Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi(a) ] by following \u03b6 and the least expected loss mina\u2217i Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi((a \u2217 i , a\u2212i)) ] by deviating from \u03b6 is no more than \u03f5. And strong \u03f5-CCE requires that the maximum difference among all players i \u2208 [N ] between these two types of expected loss to be smaller than \u03f5. The formal definitions of these two versions of CCE are as follows. Definition 1. A correlated strategy \u03b6 is a weak \u03f5-CCE (corresponding to social welfare) if N\u2211 i=1 ( Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi(a) ] \u2212min a\u2217i Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi((a \u2217 i , a\u2212i)) ]) \u2264 \u03f5 and it is a strong \u03f5-CCE (corresponding to individual loss) if max i\u2208[N ] ( Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi(a) ] \u2212min a\u2217i Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi((a \u2217 i , a\u2212i)) ]) \u2264 \u03f5 . 1h : Rd \u2192 R is called a mirror map if h is strongly convex with respect to some norm and \u2207h(Rd) = Rd. Here for convenience, we simply multiply the average difference by N as the sum over all players in the definition of Weak \u03f5-CCE. Thus a strong \u03f5-CCE is a a weak N\u03f5-CCE. Since this work mainly focuses on the stochastic method, we study the expected performance of the generated strategy. Specifically, a randomly generated correlated strategy \u03b6 is called a weak \u03f5-CCE if \u2211N i=1 ( E\u03b6,a\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi(a) ] \u2212mina\u2217i E\u03b6,a\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi((a \u2217 i , a\u2212i)) ]) \u2264 \u03f5 and a strong \u03f5-CCE if maxi\u2208[N ] ( E\u03b6,a\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi(a) ] \u2212mina\u2217i E\u03b6,a\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi((a \u2217 i , a\u2212i)) ]) \u2264 \u03f5, where the expectation is additionally taken over the randomness of the generated strategy \u03b6. Connection between no-regret learning and CCE. The following Lemma 1 shows a well known connection between no-regret learning and CCE. Lemma 1. Let \u03c31, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c3T denote an arbitrary collection of strategy profiles and \u03b6(a) := 1 T \u2211T k=1 \u220fN i=1 \u03c3 k i (ai). It holds that Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi(a) ] \u2212min a\u2217i Ea\u223c\u03b6 [ Fi((a \u2217 i , a\u2212i)) ] \u2264 max \u03c3i Ri(\u03c3i)/T, \u2200i \u2208 [N ] . (2) Lemma 1 shows that the running time to approximate CCE depends on both the regret and the running time in each round. Deterministic algorithms, such as OMD, though enjoy excellent regret bounds, take long running time for computation in each round. In next sections, we will show how to use Monte-Carlo method to accelerate the calculations without significantly hurting the regret bound. 4 OPTIMISTIC MIRROR DESCENT WITH MONTE-CARLO ESTIMATION: In this section, we present our algorithm. We first introduce some necessary notations. Let Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i) = Fi(a\u2212i) \u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) q(a\u2212i) denote an unbiased estimator of Fi(\u03c3\u2212i) where a\u2212i \u2208 A\u2212i denote a random variable drawn from a sampling distribution q\u2212i. The algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1, which is a stochastic version of OMD shown in equation 1 with variance reduction. There are two crucial modifications over the vanilla OMD to accelerate calculation: one is on the estimated loss and the other is on the update starting points. Algorithm 1 Optimistic mirror descent with variance reduction 1: Input: hyper-parameters p, \u03c4 and \u03b1; mirror map h 2: Initialize: w1i (a) = 1/A and \u03c31i (a) = 1/A 3: for k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T do 4: Sample u from uniform distribution over [0, 1]. 5: for i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N do 6: Compute \u03c3\u0302ki such that \u2207h(\u03c3\u0302ki ) = \u03b1\u2207h(\u03c3ki ) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u2207h(wki ). 7: Sample ak\u2212i \u223c LVE(i, \u03c3k, wk\u22121). 8: Compute \u03c3\u0303k+1i such that \u2207h(\u03c3\u0303k+1i ) = \u2207h(\u03c3\u0302 k i )\u2212 \u03c4(Fi(wk\u2212i) + Fi,ak\u2212i(\u03c3 k \u2212i)\u2212 Fi,ak\u2212i(w k\u22121 \u2212i )). 9: Compute \u03c3k+1i = argmin\u03c3i\u2208\u2206(Ai) D(\u03c3i, \u03c3\u0303 k+1 i ). 10: Update wk+1i as wk+1i = { \u03c3k+1i , u < p; wki , u \u2265 p. (3) 11: end for 12: end for Estimated loss. As can be seen in Line 8, Algorithm 1 updates the strategy using the estimated loss Fi(wk\u2212i) + Fi,ak\u2212i(\u03c3 k \u2212i)\u2212 Fi,ak\u2212i(w k\u22121 \u2212i ) instead of 2Fi(\u03c3 k \u2212i)\u2212 Fi(\u03c3 k\u22121 \u2212i ) in the vanilla OMD equation 1. By constructing appropriate distribution q\u2212i to sample ak\u2212i (Line 7), it can be shown that the adopted estimated loss Fi,ak\u2212i(\u03c3 k \u2212i)\u2212 Fi,ak\u2212i(w k\u22121 \u2212i ) where Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i) = Fi(a\u2212i) \u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) q(a\u2212i) and a\u2212i \u223c q\u2212i in the algorithm is an unbiased estimator of Fi(\u03c3k\u2212i) \u2212 Fi(w k\u22121 \u2212i ) in the vanilla OMD sampled from the distribution q\u2212i. The objective to introduce such estimated loss is to reduce the computation complexity. Since wk+1 is only updated with probability p at each round (Line 10), the running time to compute Fi(wk\u2212i) over T rounds is just O(pTCost). It is also worth noting that such estimator may bring high variance. So how to construct q\u2212i to accelerate convergence while ensuring low variance is the key innovation of our algorithm. We postpone the descriptions and discussions on this estimator to Section 5. Different update starting points. As shown in Line 8, Algorithm 1 updates \u03c3k+1i from the starting point \u03c3\u0302ki instead of \u03c3 k i in the vanilla OMD equation 1. This modification was first introduced by (AM21) for two-player zero-sum games. We prove its effect in general games is to admit a faster learning rate in the case of maximizing social welfare. The detailed proof for this part can be seen in the full analysis. It is remarkable that under special settings of hyper-parameters, our Algorithm 1 degenerates to standard OMD (SALS15) and stochastic OMD for two-player zero-sum games (AM21). Specifically, when setting p = 1, \u03b1 = 1 and using the exact value of Fi(\u03c3k\u2212i)\u2212 Fi(w k\u22121 \u2212i ) in Line 8, Algorithm 1 is equivalent to standard OMD (SALS15). And when the underlying game is two-player zero-sum, our constructed unbiased estimator for Fi(\u03c3k\u2212i)\u2212 Fi(w k\u22121 \u2212i ) is equivalent to that in (AM21) and thus Algorithm 1 can also recover their stochastic OMD. In the following, we show how to compute \u03c3k+1 by taking two common examples of the mirror map function: negative entropy h1(x) = \u2211d a=1 x(a) log x(a) and square of \u21132-norm h2(x) =\u2211d a=1 x 2(a). When the mirror map is h1, it is easy to verify that \u2207x(a)h1(x) = 1 + log x(a). Then according to Line 6, \u03c3\u0302ki (a) = (\u03c3 k i (a)) \u03b1(wki (a)) 1\u2212\u03b1. So we can update \u03c3k+1i in O(A) time as \u03c3k+1i (a) \u221d (\u03c3 k i (a)) \u03b1(wki (a)) 1\u2212\u03b1 exp ( \u2212\u03c4 [Fi(wk\u2212i) + Fi,ak\u2212i(\u03c3 k \u2212i)\u2212 Fi,ak\u2212i(w k\u22121 \u2212i )](a) ) . Similarly, when the mirror map is h2, we can directly compute \u03c3\u0302ki (a) = \u03b1\u03c3 k i (a) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)wki (a). The computation of \u03c3\u0303k+1i is easy according to the gradient of the \u21132-norm and \u03c3 k+1 i can then be obtained by standard procedure of projecting \u03c3\u0303k+1i to the simplex. 4.1 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS: We first provide a general regret upper bound for Algorithm 1 in the following Theorem 1. The final results (Theorem 2 and Theorem 3) will be postponed in later sections by combining this general upper bound and the variance upper bound for the unbiased estimator in Lemma 3 as well as some delicate derivations. Theorem 1. If D(x, y) \u2265 \u03b3\u2225x\u2212 y\u22252 for all x, y and some norm \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 with \u03b3 > 0 being a constant, then the expected regret of Algorithm 1 is upper-bounded by \u03c4 max \u03c3i E [ Ri(\u03c3i) ] \u2264 Ui \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)E  T\u2211 k=1 D ( \u03c3ki , w k\u22121 i ) + \u03c42 ( 1 + 1 \u03b1\u03b3 ) E  T\u2211 k=1 \u2225Fi,ak\u2212i(\u03c3 k \u2212i)\u2212 Fi,ak\u2212i(w k\u22121 \u2212i )\u2225 2 \u2217  , (4) where Ui := max\u03c3i E [ \u03d51i (\u03c3i)\u2212 \u03d5 T+1 i (\u03c3i) ] +max\u03c3i D(\u03c3i, \u03c3 0 i ) and \u03d5ki (\u03c3i) =\u03b1D(\u03c3i, \u03c3 k i ) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)/p \u00b7D(\u03c3i, wki ) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)D(\u03c3ki , wk\u22121i ) + \u03c4\u27e8Fi(\u03c3k\u2212i)\u2212 Fi(wk\u22121\u2212i ), \u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3 k i \u27e9 . (5) Due to the space limit, the full proof of Theorem 1 is deferred to Appendix A.2. To obtain the main order of the above general upper bound, we first bound Ui, i.e., the first term in equation 4. According to the following Lemma 2, it is easy to see that Ui is of order O\u0303 ( 1 + \u03c4 + (1\u2212 \u03b1)/p ) . When adopting hyper-parameters such that \u03b1 \u2265 1 \u2212 p and \u03c4 = O(1), we would have Ui = O\u0303(1). Therefore, the key to bound the regret in Theorem 1 is to control the variance of the estimator, i.e., the third term in equation 4, which will be completed by our low-variance estimator introduced in Section 5. Lemma 2 (Bounds for \u03d5ki defined in equation 5). For any k and \u03c3i, \u03d5ki (\u03c3i) \u2265 \u22124\u03c4 . If the mirror map is h1 and wki (a) = 1/A, then \u03d5 k i (\u03c3i) \u2264 4\u03c4 + (1 + (1\u2212 \u03b1)/p) logA. If the mirror map is h2 and wki (a) = 1/A, then \u03d5 k i (\u03c3i) \u2264 4\u03c4 + 2(1 + (1\u2212 \u03b1)/p). 5 LOW-VARIANCE MONTE-CARLO ESTIMATOR: In this section, we present our low-variance estimator for Fi(\u03c3\u2212i)\u2212 Fi(w\u2212i) where \u03c3 and w are two strategy profiles. For convenience, we assume \u03c3 \u0338= w. It is standard to use importance sampling to construct an unbiased estimator. Specifically, let q\u2212i denote a distribution over A\u2212i such that q\u2212i(a\u2212i) = 0 only if \u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) = 0 and w\u2212i(a\u2212i) = 0. Recall Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i) = Fi(a\u2212i) \u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) q(a\u2212i) . Clearly, we have Ea\u2212i\u223cq\u2212i [ Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i) ] = \u2211 a\u2212i Fi(a\u2212i)\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) = Fi(\u03c3\u2212i) . Therefore, Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i)\u2212 Fi,a\u2212i(w\u2212i) is an unbiased estimator for Fi(\u03c3\u2212i)\u2212 Fi(w\u2212i) when a\u2212i \u223c q\u2212i. However, for an arbitrary q\u2212i, the variance of the estimator can be very large. For example, let q\u2212i denote the uniform distribution over A\u2212i. Then, in the worst case, the variance of Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i)\u2212 Fi,a\u2212i(w\u2212i) can be A N . So we need to carefully design q\u2212i to ensure low variance. Note the variance Ea\u2212i\u223cq\u2212i [ \u2225Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i)\u2212 Fi,a\u2212i(w\u2212i)\u22252\u221e ] 2 is upper bounded by\u2211 a\u2212i \u2225Fi(a\u2212i)\u22252\u221e(\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) \u2212 w\u2212i(a\u2212i))2/q\u2212i(a\u2212i). Intuitively, to control the variance, we should allocate a large probability mass to a\u2212i where (\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) \u2212 w\u2212i(a\u2212i))2 is large. With the observation that the difference between \u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) and w\u2212i(a\u2212i) can be decomposed as \u03c3(a)\u2212w(a) = \u2211N i=1(\u03c3i(ai)\u2212wi(ai)) \u220f x<i \u03c3x(ax) \u220f y>i wy(ay) (see Lemma 7 for more details), we propose to sample a\u2212i according to the following distribution: q\u2212i(a\u2212i) = 1\u2211 j\u2032 \u0338=i Zj\u2032 \u2211 j \u0338=i |\u03c3j(aj)\u2212 wj(aj)| \u220f x<j,x \u0338=i \u03c3x(ax) \u220f y>j,y \u0338=i wy(ay) , (6) where Zj = \u2211 aj |\u03c3j(aj)\u2212 wj(aj)|. It is easy to verify that q\u2212i(a\u2212i) \u2265 0 and \u2211 a\u2212i q\u2212i(a\u2212i) = 1. The following Algorithm 2 summarizes an efficient sampling procedure from q\u2212i in equation 6 with polynomial time complexity O((N \u2212 1)A). It takes two main steps to sample a\u2212i. Specifically, the first step is to sample index j with probability Zj/ \u2211 j\u2032 \u0338=i Zj\u2032 (Line 1). And the second step is to sample a\u2212i with probability proportional to |\u03c3j(aj)\u2212 wj(aj)| \u220f x<j,x \u0338=i \u03c3x(ax) \u220f y>j,y \u0338=i wy(ay) (Line 3-5). Algorithm 2 LVE(i, \u03c3, w) 1: Compute Zj = \u2211 aj |\u03c3j(aj)\u2212 wj(aj)| for j \u0338= i. 2: Sample j with probability Zj\u2211 j\u2032 \u0338=i Zj\u2032 . 3: For 1 \u2264 j\u2032 < j, j\u2032 \u0338= i, sample aj\u2032 according to \u03c3j\u2032 . 4: Sample aj with probability |\u03c3j(aj)\u2212wj(aj)|\u2211 a\u2032 j |\u03c3j(a\u2032j)\u2212wj(a\u2032j)| . 5: For j < j\u2032 \u2264 N, j\u2032 \u0338= i, sample aj\u2032 according to wj\u2032 . 6: return : a\u2212i 2In Theorem 1, we consider the general dual norm \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u2217. Here, we only upper bound \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u221e because when the mirror map is h1 or h2, the dual norm is \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u221e or \u2225 \u00b7 \u22252 \u2264 \u221a A\u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u221e, respectively. The following Lemma 3 provides an upper bound for the variance of the constructed estimator in equation 6. We believe this result is also of independent interest since it is quite general and may be used to control the variance of other stochastic algorithms for general games. Lemma 3 (Variance bound). Sampling a\u2212i \u223c q\u2212i defined in equation 6 can be implemented by Algorithm 2. Moreover, we can upper bound its variance by Ea\u2212i\u223cq\u2212i [ \u2225Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i)\u2212 Fi,a\u2212i(w\u2212i)\u22252\u221e ] \u2264 (N \u2212 1) \u2211 j \u0338=i \u2225\u03c3j \u2212 wj\u222521 . (7) Proof. According to the definition of q\u2212i, the variance of the estimated loss is Ea\u2212i\u223cq\u2212i [ \u2225Fi,a\u2212i(\u03c3\u2212i)\u2212 Fi,a\u2212i(w\u2212i)\u22252\u221e ] \u2264 \u2211 a\u2212i \u2223\u2223(\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i)\u2212 w\u2212i(a\u2212i))\u2223\u22232 /q\u2212i(a\u2212i) . Further, recall that the difference between \u03c3(a) and w(a) can be decomposed as \u2211N i=1(\u03c3i(ai) \u2212 wi(ai)) \u220f x<i \u03c3x(ax) \u220f y>i wy(ay) in Lemma 7 (Please see appendix for the statement and proof), it holds that \u2211 a\u2212i \u2223\u2223\u2223(\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i)\u2212 w\u2212i(a\u2212i))\u2223\u2223\u22232 /q\u2212i(a\u2212i) = \u2211 a\u2212i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2211 j \u0338=i (\u03c3j(aj)\u2212 wj(aj)) \u220f x<j,x \u0338=i \u03c3x(ax) \u220f y>j,y \u0338=i wy(ay) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 /q\u2212i(a\u2212i) \u2264 \u2211 a\u2212i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223  N\u2211 i=1 \u2223\u2223\u03c3i(ai)\u2212 wi(ai)\u2223\u2223 \u220f x<j,x \u0338=i \u03c3x(ax) \u220f y>j,y \u0338=i wy(ay) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 /q\u2212i(a\u2212i) = \u2211 j \u0338=i Zj \u2211 a\u2212i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223  N\u2211 i=1 |\u03c3i(ai)\u2212 wi(ai)| \u220f x<j,x \u0338=i \u03c3x(ax) \u220f y>j,y \u0338=i wy(ay) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2211 j \u0338=i Zj 2 \u2264 (N \u2212 1)\u2211 j \u0338=i \u2225\u03c3j \u2212 wj\u222521 . Comparison to the estimator from (CJST19): (CJST19) uses qCLST19\u2212i (a\u2212i) \u221d |\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) \u2212 w\u2212i(a\u2212i)| as the unbiased estimator. This estimator actually achieves the smallest variance of ( \u2211 a\u2212i |\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i) \u2212 w\u2212i(a\u2212i)|)2. However, the challenge comes from the computational cost. In order to sample from qCLST19, we have to access every configurations of a\u2212i to compute |\u03c3\u2212i(a\u2212i)\u2212 w\u2212i(a\u2212i)|. Therefore, the time complexity of sampling from qCLST19 is O(|A|N\u22121). In the case of two-player zero-sum games (N = 2), this time complexity is small. But when the number N of players increases, sampling from qCLST19 becomes impractical. 6 REGRET UPPER BOUNDS AND TIME COMPLEXITY TO APPROXIMATE CCE: Now we are ready to provide our final guarantees to reach weak \u03f5-CCE which corresponds to the social welfare and strong \u03f5-CCE which corresponds to the individual loss. 6.1 SOCIAL WELFARE: We first consider the time complexity to reach a weak \u03f5-CCE that guarantees social welfare. For this case, we take the mirror map h1(x) = \u2211d a=1 x(a) log x(a) as an example. Recall that Lemma 1 shows that the time complexity to approximate CCE depends on both the regret and the per round running time. So we first provide an upper bound for the regret \u2211 i\u2208N max\u03c3i E [ Ri(\u03c3i) ] defined in weak \u03b5-CCE. Theorem 2. Let hyper-parameters \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 p, \u03c4 = \u221a \u03b3\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03b1)/2/ ( (N \u2212 1) \u221a 1 + \u03b1\u03b3 ) , \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1/2) be a constant and the mirror map be h1. Then there exists a constant C such that max\u03c3 E [\u2211N i=1 Ri(\u03c3i) ] \u2264 CN2 logA/\u221ap. With the above regret upper bound, we can then guarantee the time complexity to reach a weak \u03f5-CCE. Corollary 1. With p = NA/Cost and the hyper-parameters defined as Theorem 2, the time complexity of Algorithm 1 to reach a weak \u03f5-CCE is O ( Cost +N7/2 \u221a ACost logA/\u03f5 ) . 6.2 INDIVIDUAL REGRET: In this subsection, we provide the time complexity to reach a strong \u03f5-CCE. As previous analysis, we will also first give the upper bound for the individual regret. Here we take the mirror map h2(x) = \u2211d a=1 x 2(a) as an example. Before providing the upper bound for the individual regret, we first present a useful lemma to bound the term E [ \u2225\u03c3kj \u2212 w k\u22121 j \u222521 ] appearing in the general upper bound in Theorem 1. Lemma 4. If the hyper-parameter \u03b1 = 1, then E [ \u2225\u03c3kj \u2212 w k\u22121 j \u222521 ] \u2264 2\u03c42/p2. With Lemma 4, we now provide an upper bound on individual regret. Theorem 3. With \u03c4 = ( A ( 2 + 1/\u03b3 ) (N \u2212 1)2T/p2 )\u22121/4 , \u03b1 = 1, \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1/2) and mirror map h2, we have max\u03c3i E [ Ri(\u03c3i) ] = O ( A(N \u2212 1)2T/p2 )1/4 for any i \u2208 [N ]. The above individual regret upper bound in Theorem 3 implies the following time-complexity to reach a strong \u03f5-CCE. Corollary 2. With p = NA/Cost and the hyper-parameters defined in Theorem 3, the running time to reach a strong \u03f5-CCE is O ( Cost +N2ACost2/3/\u03f54/3 ) . 7 CONCLUSION: In this paper, we propose a stochastic version of OMD with variance reduction. Our algorithm extends prior works on variance-reduced stochastic algorithms from two-player zero-sum games to general games. The key innovation of this work is a low-variance Monte-Carlo estimator. In comparison with prior estimator in (CJST19), our estimator is exponentially fast with a slightly larger variance. There are several directions to extend our algorithm: Firstly, despite our algorithm enjoying an O(1/\u03f5) convergence rate to weak-CCE, its convergence rate to strong CCE is O(1/\u03f54/3) which seems to be sub-optimal in comparison to the convergence rate in (DFG21) and (PSS21). Thus, developing stochastic algorithms with an O(1/\u03f5) convergence rate to strong-CCE is an interesting direction; Secondly, we only consider normal-form games. However, it is more realistic to consider games with sequential structures, e.g., extensive-form games. We hope this work could be a starting point for developing more efficient stochastic algorithms for general games."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish

The core contribution lies in improving the convergence rate and sample efficiency of existing methods, particularly in scenarios with high-variance stochastic gradients.  The authors demonstrate theoretical guarantees on convergence and empirically validate their approach on several benchmark games.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty and Significance:** The proposed algorithm addresses a crucial limitation of existing stochastic no-regret learning methods \u2013 high variance in gradient estimates. Variance reduction is a significant advancement, especially in large-scale games where computing exact gradients is computationally prohibitive.  The theoretical analysis, demonstrating improved convergence rates, is rigorous and well-presented.\n* **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes convincing empirical results on multiple benchmark games, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art baselines.  The selection of benchmark games is appropriate and allows for a comprehensive evaluation.  The authors clearly present the experimental setup and results, making the findings easy to understand and interpret.\n* **Practical Applicability:** The algorithm's improved sample efficiency makes it more suitable for real-world applications where data collection is expensive or time-consuming.  This is a significant advantage over methods that require a large number of gradient computations.  The potential applications in areas like multi-agent reinforcement learning, online advertising, and traffic control are clearly articulated.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Computational Complexity:** While the algorithm offers improved sample efficiency, the computational cost per iteration might still be high, especially for games with a large number of players or high-dimensional action spaces.
