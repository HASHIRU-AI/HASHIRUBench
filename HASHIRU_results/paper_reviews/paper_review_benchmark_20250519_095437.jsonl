The paper title is: Shallow Learning In Materio.\n\nNone: We introduce Shallow Learning In Materio (SLIM) as a resource-efficient method to realize closed-loop higher-order perceptrons. Our SLIM method provides a rebuttal to the Minsky school\u2019s disputes with the Rosenblatt school about the efficacy of learning representations in shallow perceptrons. As a proof-of-concept, here we devise a physically-scalable realization of the parity function. Our findings are relevant to artificial intelligence engineers, as well as neuroscientists and biologists. 1 INTRODUCTION: How do we best learn representations? We do not yet fully understand how cognition is manifested in any brain, not even in those of a worm (Rankin, 2004). It is an open question if the shallow brain of a worm is capable of working memory, but if it were then it certainly must depart from the mechanistic models of large-scale brains (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Nevertheless, worm-brain inspired learning combined with \u201dscalable\u201d deep learning architectures have been employed in self-driving cars (Lechner et al., 2020). At present, by scalable we refer to TPU-based architectures (Jouppi et al., 2017; Rumelhart et al., 1986) trained by gradient-descent. However, one could envision a super-scalable future that is less synthetic and based on self-organized nanomaterial systems (Bose et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020; Mirigliano et al., 2021) that natively realize higher-order (Lawrence, 2022a) and recurrent neural networks. In this short communication, we shall lay yet another brick towards such a future by providing theoretical arguments. Our perspective on cognitive material systems is illuminated in Figure 1. Deep learning owes its success to our technological capacity to synthesize massively-parallel and programmable electronic circuits. It is yet to fully exploit Darwinian and Hebbian learning methods that pioneers of the cybernetics movement experimented with by training homeostats (Ashby, 1952) and perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1961). The spirit of Darwinian (Stanley et al., 2019) and Hebbian (Scellier & Bengio, 2017) learning continues to be alive, though. Here, we add fuel to that fire by advocating for an in-materio approach. Employing physical systems in their native form for solving computational tasks had gained attention due to the efforts of the \u2019evolution in materio\u2019 community (Miller & Downing, 2002). The earliest result was by Pask (1960) who grew dendritic metallic threads in a ferrous sulphate solution to function as a sound-frequency discriminator (which he called an ear, quite romantically). Now, more recent efforts are under the banner of physical reservoir computing (Tanaka et al., 2019) for realizing sequential functionality. Here, we will commit to combinational functionality by equilibrium-point logic (Lawrence, 2022b) in material systems realizing closed-loop higher-order perceptrons. 2 THEORY: Perceptrons were developed by Rosenblatt and his team, and were trained by a Hebbian learning rule (error-controlled reinforcement) with proven guarantees for convergence. Unfortunately, they started recieving a bad rap after Minsky & Papert (1988) published a proof that 2N association neurons are required to learn the N -bit parity function. However, this analysis is only applicable if all neurons are threshold logic gates, what Rosenblatt called simple units. Physical neural networks, on the other hand, can natively realize complex units. We introduce a shallow learning in materio (SLIM) perceptron as depicted in Figure 2. For our proof-of-concept, we commit to a minimally connected recurrent network with physical states si from i = 1 : N , yielding a state-space model of the form s\u0307i = xi + Fi(si\u22121, si, si+1), (1) where Fi is a nonlinear function. We conjecture that all possible N -bit functions may be realized if arbitrary choices of F1:N are allowed. Imposing conditions of physical realizability on Fi would affect the neuronal capacity (Baldi & Vershynin, 2018) of our SLIM perceptron, and at present there is no engineering theory to design an optimal Fi (even when N = 2). As a step to that, we demonstrate equilibrium-point logic in Figure 3 with F1:2 designed as piecewise-constant functions. A promising approach to obtain Fi for higher dimensions is to identify an analogy with cellular automaton that are capable of equilibrium-point parity logic in arbitrary dimensions (Betel et al., 2013). Obtaining scaling laws for the volume of state-space in action during equilibrium-point logic may be another worthy problem to ponder upon. 3 CONCLUSION: Our contribution here is threefold: (1) a typology of cognitive material systems that puts a spotlight on yet-to-be-appreciated alternatives to deep learning, (2) arguments to support the investigation of recurrent networks for deep feedforward functionality, (3) framing open problems in equilibriumpoint logic. More theory is needed to develop constructive high-dimensional examples, and a statistical analysis of SLIM\u2019s performance. Next steps could be to obtain estimates on the learning duration, and check if it is superior to estimates obtained from the principal convergence theorem for perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1961, Section 5.5, Theorem 4). Given the well established (in silico) deep learning industry, even with a more practical demonstration, business economics would prevent the shift to a SLIM paradigm in the near future. Nevertheless, the SLIM concept may act as a catalyst for gifted mathematicians to make new connections or help neuroscientists in unravelling the mysteries of small-scale brains."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will create three agents to review the paper \"Shallow Learning In Materio\".

The authors argue that this approach offers a resource-efficient alternative to traditional deep learning, drawing parallels to biological neural systems and referencing the historical debate between the \"Minsky school\" and the \"Rosenblatt school\" on the capabilities of shallow networks.  The paper presents a theoretical framework, a proof-of-concept example for the parity function, and identifies open problems for future research.\n\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty (in a specific niche):** The concept of leveraging physical material properties for computation, specifically within the context of higher-order perceptrons, presents a novel perspective.  The connection to biological systems and the historical context of the perceptron debate adds an interesting angle.\n* **Identifies Open Problems:** The paper clearly articulates open research questions related to the design of the nonlinear functions *F<sub>i</sub>*, scaling laws for state-space volume, and the analysis of learning duration.  This is crucial for guiding future work.\n* **Clear Structure:**  The paper is relatively well-structured, proceeding logically from background to theory to a proof-of-concept and concluding with open problems.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Rigorous Theoretical Foundation:** The core theoretical claim\u2014that arbitrary N-bit functions can be realized with appropriate choices of *F<sub>i</sub>*\u2014is presented as a conjecture without substantial mathematical justification.  The paper lacks a formal proof or even a compelling heuristic argument for this claim.  The \"proof-of-concept\" is limited to a simple 2-bit parity function, far from demonstrating the generality claimed.\n* **Overly Ambitious Claims:** The paper makes sweeping statements about challenging the Minsky-Papert critique of perceptrons. While the authors correctly point out the limitations of Minsky and Papert's analysis when applied to non-threshold logic gates,  the current work falls short of providing a convincing rebuttal. The connection to the historical debate feels somewhat forced.\n* **Vague on Physical Realizability:** The paper mentions \"physical realizability\" but provides no concrete details on the physical systems that would instantiate the proposed model.  The discussion of materials and their properties is extremely superficial.\n* **Limited Practical Significance (at present):** The authors acknowledge the current dominance of in silico deep learning. The paper offers no compelling reason why SLIM would be practically advantageous, even with further development. The potential benefits are largely speculative.\n* **Proof of Concept is Weak:** The presented proof-of-concept is rudimentary and does not convincingly demonstrate the scalability or potential advantages of the proposed approach.  A more robust demonstration with a higher-dimensional example or a comparative analysis against existing methods would be essential.\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting, albeit highly speculative, idea.

We do not yet fully understand how cognition is manifested in any brain, not even in those of a worm (Rankin, 2004). It is an open question if the shallow brain of a worm is capable of working memory, but if it were then it certainly must depart from the mechanistic models of large-scale brains (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Nevertheless, worm-brain inspired learning combined with \u201dscalable\u201d deep learning architectures have been employed in self-driving cars (Lechner et al., 2020). At present, by scalable we refer to TPU-based architectures (Jouppi et al., 2017; Rumelhart et al., 1986) trained by gradient-descent. However, one could envision a super-scalable future that is less synthetic and based on self-organized nanomaterial systems (Bose et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020; Mirigliano et al., 2021) that natively realize higher-order (Lawrence, 2022a) and recurrent neural networks. In this short communication, we shall lay yet another brick towards such a future by providing theoretical arguments. Our perspective on cognitive material systems is illuminated in Figure 1. Deep learning owes its success to our technological capacity to synthesize massively-parallel and programmable electronic circuits. It is yet to fully exploit Darwinian and Hebbian learning methods that pioneers of the cybernetics movement experimented with by training homeostats (Ashby, 1952) and perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1961). The spirit of Darwinian (Stanley et al., 2019) and Hebbian (Scellier & Bengio, 2017) learning continues to be alive, though. Here, we add fuel to that fire by advocating for an in-materio approach. Employing physical systems in their native form for solving computational tasks had gained attention due to the efforts of the \u2019evolution in materio\u2019 community (Miller & Downing, 2002). The earliest result was by Pask (1960) who grew dendritic metallic threads in a ferrous sulphate solution to function as a sound-frequency discriminator (which he called an ear, quite romantically). Now, more recent efforts are under the banner of physical reservoir computing (Tanaka et al., 2019) for realizing sequential functionality. Here, we will commit to combinational functionality by equilibrium-point logic (Lawrence, 2022b) in material systems realizing closed-loop higher-order perceptrons. 2 THEORY: Perceptrons were developed by Rosenblatt and his team, and were trained by a Hebbian learning rule (error-controlled reinforcement) with proven guarantees for convergence. Unfortunately, they started recieving a bad rap after Minsky & Papert (1988) published a proof that 2N association neurons are required to learn the N -bit parity function. However, this analysis is only applicable if all neurons are threshold logic gates, what Rosenblatt called simple units. Physical neural networks, on the other hand, can natively realize complex units. We introduce a shallow learning in materio (SLIM) perceptron as depicted in Figure 2. For our proof-of-concept, we commit to a minimally connected recurrent network with physical states si from i = 1 : N , yielding a state-space model of the form s\u0307i = xi + Fi(si\u22121, si, si+1), (1) where Fi is a nonlinear function. We conjecture that all possible N -bit functions may be realized if arbitrary choices of F1:N are allowed. Imposing conditions of physical realizability on Fi would affect the neuronal capacity (Baldi & Vershynin, 2018) of our SLIM perceptron, and at present there is no engineering theory to design an optimal Fi (even when N = 2). As a step to that, we demonstrate equilibrium-point logic in Figure 3 with F1:2 designed as piecewise-constant functions. A promising approach to obtain Fi for higher dimensions is to identify an analogy with cellular automaton that are capable of equilibrium-point parity logic in arbitrary dimensions (Betel et al., 2013). Obtaining scaling laws for the volume of state-space in action during equilibrium-point logic may be another worthy problem to ponder upon. 3 CONCLUSION: Our contribution here is threefold: (1) a typology of cognitive material systems that puts a spotlight on yet-to-be-appreciated alternatives to deep learning, (2) arguments to support the investigation of recurrent networks for deep feedforward functionality, (3) framing open problems in equilibriumpoint logic. More theory is needed to develop constructive high-dimensional examples, and a statistical analysis of SLIM\u2019s performance. Next steps could be to obtain estimates on the learning duration, and check if it is superior to estimates obtained from the principal convergence theorem for perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1961, Section 5.5, Theorem 4). Given the well established (in silico) deep learning industry, even with a more practical demonstration, business economics would prevent the shift to a SLIM paradigm in the near future. Nevertheless, the SLIM concept may act as a catalyst for gifted mathematicians to make new connections or help neuroscientists in unravelling the mysteries of small-scale brains.

The earliest result was by Pask (1960) who grew dendritic metallic threads in a ferrous sulphate solution to function as a sound-frequency discriminator (which he called an ear, quite romantically). Now, more recent efforts are under the banner of physical reservoir computing (Tanaka et al., 2019) for realizing sequential functionality. Here, we will commit to combinational functionality by equilibrium-point logic (Lawrence, 2022b) in material systems realizing closed-loop higher-order perceptrons. 2 THEORY: Perceptrons were developed by Rosenblatt and his team, and were trained by a Hebbian learning rule (error-controlled reinforcement) with proven guarantees for convergence. Unfortunately, they started recieving a bad rap after Minsky & Papert (1988) published a proof that 2N association neurons are required to learn the N -bit parity function. However, this analysis is only applicable if all neurons are threshold logic gates, what Rosenblatt called simple units. Physical neural networks, on the other hand, can natively realize complex units. We introduce a shallow learning in materio (SLIM) perceptron as depicted in Figure 2. For our proof-of-concept, we commit to a minimally connected recurrent network with physical states si from i = 1 : N , yielding a state-space model of the form s\u0307i = xi + Fi(si\u22121, si, si+1), (1) where Fi is a nonlinear function. We conjecture that all possible N -bit functions may be realized if arbitrary choices of F1:N are allowed. Imposing conditions of physical realizability on Fi would affect the neuronal capacity (Baldi & Vershynin, 2018) of our SLIM perceptron, and at present there is no engineering theory to design an optimal Fi (even when N = 2). As a step to that, we demonstrate equilibrium-point logic in Figure 3 with F1:2 designed as piecewise-constant functions. A promising approach to obtain Fi for higher dimensions is to identify an analogy with cellular automaton that are capable of equilibrium-point parity logic in arbitrary dimensions (Betel et al., 2013). Obtaining scaling laws for the volume of state-space in action during equilibrium-point logic may be another worthy problem to ponder upon. 3 CONCLUSION: Our contribution here is threefold: (1) a typology of cognitive material systems that puts a spotlight on yet-to-be-appreciated alternatives to deep learning, (2) arguments to support the investigation of recurrent networks for deep feedforward functionality, (3) framing open problems in equilibriumpoint logic. More theory is needed to develop constructive high-dimensional examples, and a statistical analysis of SLIM\u2019s performance. Next steps could be to obtain estimates on the learning duration, and check if it is superior to estimates obtained from the principal convergence theorem for perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1961, Section 5.5, Theorem 4). Given the well established (in silico) deep learning industry, even with a more practical demonstration, business economics would prevent the shift to a SLIM paradigm in the near future. Nevertheless, the SLIM concept may act as a catalyst for gifted mathematicians to make new connections or help neuroscientists in unravelling the mysteries of small-scale brains.

The paper title is: Shallow Learning In Materio. None: We introduce Shallow Learning In Materio (SLIM) as a resource-efficient method to realize closed-loop higher-order perceptrons. Our SLIM method provides a rebuttal to the Minsky school\u2019s disputes with the Rosenblatt school about the efficacy of learning representations in shallow perceptrons. As a proof-of-concept, here we devise a physically-scalable realization of the parity function. Our findings are relevant to artificial intelligence engineers, as well as neuroscientists and biologists. 1 INTRODUCTION: How do we best learn representations? We do not yet fully understand how cognition is manifested in any brain, not even in those of a worm (Rankin, 2004). It is an open question if the shallow brain of a worm is capable of working memory, but if it were then it certainly must depart from the mechanistic models of large-scale brains (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Nevertheless, worm-brain inspired learning combined with \u201dscalable\u201d deep learning architectures have been employed in self-driving cars (Lechner et al., 2020). At present, by scalable we refer to TPU-based architectures (Jouppi et al., 2017; Rumelhart et al., 1986) trained by gradient-descent. However, one could envision a super-scalable future that is less synthetic and based on self-organized nanomaterial systems (Bose et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020; Mirigliano et al., 2021) that natively realize higher-order (Lawrence, 2022a) and recurrent neural networks. In this short communication, we shall lay yet another brick towards such a future by providing theoretical arguments. Our perspective on cognitive material systems is illuminated in Figure 1. Deep learning owes its success to our technological capacity to synthesize massively-parallel and programmable electronic circuits. It is yet to fully exploit Darwinian and Hebbian learning methods that pioneers of the cybernetics movement experimented with by training homeostats (Ashby, 1952) and perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1961). The spirit of Darwinian (Stanley et al., 2019) and Hebbian (Scellier & Bengio, 2017) learning continues to be alive, though. Here, we add fuel to that fire by advocating for an in-materio approach.
