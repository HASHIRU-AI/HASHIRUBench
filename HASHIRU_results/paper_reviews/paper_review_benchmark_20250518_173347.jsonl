The paper title is: Does Federated Learning Really Need Backpropagation?\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Federated learning (FL) allows decentralized clients to collaboratively train a server model (Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al., 2016; McMahan et al., 2017). In each training round, the selected clients compute model gradients or updates on their local private datasets, without explicitly exchanging sample points to the server. While FL describes a promising blueprint and has several applications (Yang et al., 2018; Hard et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020a), the mainstream training paradigm of FL is still gradient-based that requires the clients to locally execute backpropagation, which leads to two practical limitations: (i) Overhead for edge devices. The clients in FL are usually edge devices, such as mobile phones and IoT sensors, whose hardware is primarily optimized for inference-only purposes (Sharma et al., 2018; Umuroglu et al., 2018), rather than for backpropagation. Due to the limited resources, computationally affordable models running on edge devices are typically quantized and pruned (Wang et al., 2019a), making exact backpropagation difficult. In addition, standard implementations of backpropagation rely on either forward-mode or reverse-mode auto-differentiation in contemporary machine learning packages (Bradbury et al., 2018; Paszke et al., 2019), which increases storage requirements. (ii) White-box vulnerability. To facilitate gradient computing, the server regularly distributes its model status to the clients, but this white-box exposure of the model renders the server vulnerable to, e.g., poisoning or inversion attacks from malicious clients (Shokri et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Geiping et al., 2020). With that, recent attempts are made to exploit trusted execution environments (TEEs) in FL, which can isolate the model status within a black-box secure area and significantly reduce the success rate of malicious evasion (Chen et al., 2020; Mo et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Mondal et al., 2021). However, TEEs are highly memory-constrained (Truong et al., 2021), while backpropagation is memory-consuming to restore intermediate states. While numerous solutions have been proposed to alleviate these limitations (as discussed in Section 5), in this paper, we raise an essential question: does FL really need backpropagation? Inspired by the literature on zero-order optimization (Stein, 1981), we intend to substitute backpropagation with multiple forward or inference processes to estimate the gradients. Technically speaking, we propose the framework of BAckpropagation-Free Federated LEarning (BAFFLE). As illustrated in Figure 1, BAFFLE consists of three conceptual steps: (1) each client locally perturbs the model parameters 2K times as W\u00b1\u03b4k (the server sends the random seed to clients for generating {\u03b4k}Kk=1); (2) each client executes forward processes on the perturbed models using its private dataset Dc and obtains K loss differences {\u2206L(W, \u03b4k;Dc)}Kk=1; (3) the server aggregates loss differences to estimate gradients. BAFFLE\u2019s defining characteristic is that it only utilizes forward propagation, which is memoryefficient and does not require auto-differentiation. It is well-adapted to model quantization and pruning as well as inference-only hardware optimization on edge devices. Compared to backpropagation, the computation graph of forward propagation in BAFFLE may be more easily optimized, such as by slicing it into per-layer calculation (Kim et al., 2020). Since each loss difference \u2206L(W, \u03b4k;Dc) is a scalar, BAFFLE can easily accommodate the uploading bandwidth of clients by adjusting the value of K as opposed to using, e.g., gradient compression (Suresh et al., 2017). BAFFLE is also compatible with recent advances in inference approaches for TEE (Tramer & Boneh, 2019; Truong et al., 2021), providing an efficient solution for combining TEE into FL and preventing white-box evasion. In our experiments, we evaluate the BAFFLE framework on the MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) and CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) datasets. Base on our convergence analyses, we adapt secure aggregation (Bonawitz et al., 2017a) to zero-order optimization and investigate ways to improve gradient estimation in BAFFLE. Empirically, BAFFLE achieves comparable performance to conventional FL using a relatively small value of K (as determined by ablation studies). These results shed light on the potential of BAFFLE and the effectiveness of backpropagation-free methods in FL. 2 PRELIMINARIES: In this section, we introduce the basic concepts of federated learning (FL) (Kairouz et al., 2021) and the finite difference formulas that will serve as the foundation for our methods. 2.1 FEDERATED LEARNING: Suppose we have C clients, and the c-th client\u2019s private dataset is defined as Dc := {(Xci ,yci )} Nc i=1 with Nc input-label pairs. Let L(W;Dc) represent the loss function calculated on the dataset Dc, where W \u2208 Rn denotes the server model\u2019s global parameters. The training objective of FL is to find W that minimize the total loss function as L(W) := C\u2211 c=1 Nc N L(W;Dc), where N = C\u2211 c=1 Nc. (1) In the conventional FL framework, clients locally compute gradients {\u2207WL(W;Dc)}Cc=1 or model updates through backpropagation and then upload them to the server. Federated average (McMahan et al., 2017) performs global aggregation using \u2206W := \u2211C i=1 Nc N \u2206Wc, where \u2206Wc is the local update obtained via executing Wc \u2190Wc \u2212 \u03b7\u2207WcL(Wc;Dc) multiple times and \u03b7 is learning rate. 2.2 FINITE DIFFERENCE: Gradient-based optimization techniques (either first-order or higher-order) are the most frequently used tools to train deep networks (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Nevertheless, recent progress demonstrates promising applications of zero-order optimization methods for training, particularly when exact derivatives cannot be obtained (Flaxman et al., 2004; Nesterov & Spokoiny, 2017; Liu et al., 2020a) or backward processes are computationally prohibitive (Pang et al., 2020; He et al., 2022). Zero-order approaches require only multiple forward processes that may be executed in parallel. Along this routine, finite difference stems from the definition of derivatives and can be generalized to higher-order and multivariate cases by Taylor\u2019s expansion. For any differentiable loss function L(W;D) and a small perturbation \u03b4 \u2208 Rn, finite difference employs the forward difference scheme L(W + \u03b4;D)\u2212 L(W;D) = \u03b4\u22a4\u2207WL(W;D) + o(\u2225\u03b4\u22252), (2) where \u03b4\u22a4\u2207WL(W;D) is a scaled directional derivative along \u03b4. Furthermore, we can use the central difference scheme to obtain higher-order residuals as L(W + \u03b4;D)\u2212 L(W \u2212 \u03b4;D) = 2\u03b4\u22a4\u2207WL(W;D) + o(\u2225\u03b4\u222522). (3) Finite difference formulas are typically used to estimate quantities such as gradient norm or Hessian trace, where \u03b4 is sampled from random projection vectors (Pang et al., 2020). 3 BAFFLE: BACKPROPAGATION-FREE FEDERATED LEARNING: In this section, we introduce zero-order optimization techniques into FL and develop BAFFLE, a backpropagation-free federated learning framework that uses multiple forward processes in place of backpropagation. An initial attempt is to apply finite difference as the gradient estimator. To estimate the full gradients, we need to perturb each parameter w \u2208 W once to approximate the partial derivative \u2202L(W;D)\u2202w , causing the forward computations to grow with n (recall that W \u2208 R n) and making it difficult to scale to large models. In light of this, we resort to Stein\u2019s identity (Stein, 1981) to obtain an unbiased estimation of gradients from loss differences calculated on various perturbations. As depicted in Figure 1, BAFFLE clients need only download random seeds and global parameters update, generate perturbations locally, execute multiple forward propagations and upload loss differences back to the server. Furthermore, we also present convergence analyses of BAFFLE, which provides guidelines for model design and acceleration of training progress. 3.1 UNBIASED GRADIENT ESTIMATION WITH STEIN\u2019S IDENTITY: Previous work on sign-based optimization (Moulay et al., 2019) demonstrates that deep networks can be effectively trained if the majority of gradients have proper signs. Thus, we propose performing forward propagation multiple times on perturbed parameters, in order to obtain a stochastic estimation of gradients without backpropagation. Specifically, assuming that the loss function L(W;D) is continuously differentiable w.r.t. W given any dataset D, which is true (almost everywhere) for deep networks using non-linear activation functions, we define a smoothed loss function L\u03c3(W;D) := E\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I)L(W + \u03b4;D), (4) where the perturbation \u03b4 follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance \u03c32I. Given this, Stein (1981) proves the Stein\u2019s identity (we recap the proof in Appendix A.1), formulated as \u2207WL\u03c3(W;D) = E\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I) [ \u03b4 2\u03c32 \u2206L(W, \u03b4;D) ] , (5) where \u2206L(W, \u03b4;D) := L(W+ \u03b4;D)\u2212L(W\u2212 \u03b4;D) is the loss difference. Note that computing a loss difference only requires the execution of two forward processes L(W+ \u03b4;D) and L(W\u2212 \u03b4;D) without backpropagation. It is straightforward to show that L\u03c3(W;D) is continuously differentiable for any \u03c3 \u2265 0 and \u2207WL\u03c3(W;D) converges uniformly as \u03c3 \u2192 0; hence, it follows that \u2207WL(W;D) = lim\u03c3\u21920\u2207WL\u03c3(W;D). Therefore, we can obtain a stochastic estimation of gradients using Monte Carlo approximation by 1) selecting a small value of \u03c3; 2) randomly sampling K perturbations from N (0, \u03c32I) as {\u03b4k}Kk=1; and 3) utilizing the Stein\u2019s identity in Eq. (5) to calculate \u2207\u0302WL(W;D) := 1 K K\u2211 k=1 [ \u03b4k 2\u03c32 \u2206L(W, \u03b4k;D) ] .

(6), we outline the basic operating flow of our BAFFLE system as in Algorithm 1, which consists of the following: Model initialization. (Lines 3\u223c4, done by server) The server initializes the model parameters to W0 and optionally encodes the computing paradigm of loss differences \u2206L(W, \u03b4;D) into the TEE module (see Appendix B for more information on TEE); Downloading paradigms. (Lines 6\u223c7, server\u21d2 all clients) In round t, the server distributes the most recent model parameters Wt (or the model update \u2206Wt = Wt \u2212Wt\u22121) and the computing paradigm to all the C clients. In addition, in BAFFLE, the server sends a random seed st (rather than directly sending the perturbations to reduce communication burden); Local computation. (Lines 11\u223c12, done by clients) Each client generates K perturbations {\u03b4k}Kk=1 locally from N (0, \u03c32I) using random seed st, and executes the computing paradigm to obtain loss differences. K is chosen adaptively based on clients\u2019 upload bandwidth and computation capability; Uploading loss differences. (Line 13, all clients\u21d2 server) Each client uploads K noisy outputs {\u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k;Dc) + NNc \u03f5c} K k=1 to the server, where each output is a floating-point number and the noise \u03f5c is negotiated by all clients to be zero-sum. The Bytes uploaded for K noisy outputs is 4\u00d7K; Secure aggregation. (Lines 15\u223c16, done by server) In order to prevent the server from recovering the exact loss differences and causing privacy leakage (Geiping et al., 2020), we adopt the secure aggregation method (Bonawitz et al., 2017a) that was originally proposed for conventional FL and apply it to BAFFLE. Specifically, all clients negotiate a group of noises {\u03f5c}Cc=1 satisfying\u2211C c=1 \u03f5c = 0. Then we can reorganize our gradient estimator as \u2207\u0302WtL(Wt) = 1 K C\u2211 c=1 Nc N K\u2211 k=1 [ \u03b4k 2\u03c32 \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k;Dc) ] = 1 K K\u2211 k=1 \u03b4k 2\u03c32 \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k), (7) where \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k) = \u2211C c=1 Nc N [\u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k;Dc) + N Nc \u03f5c]. Since {\u03f5c}Cc=1 are zero-sum, there is \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k) = \u2211C c=1 Nc N \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k;Dc) and Eq. (7) holds. Thus, the server can correctly aggregate \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k) and protect client privacy without recovering individual \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k;Dc). Remark. After calculating the gradient estimation \u2207\u0302WtL(Wt), the server updates the parameters to Wt+1 using techniques such as gradient descent with learning rate \u03b7. Similar to the discussion in McMahan et al. (2017), the BAFFLE form presented in Algorithm 1 corresponds to FedSGD where Lines 11\u223c12 execute once for each round t. We can generalize BAFFLE to an analog of FedAvg, in which each client updates its local parameters multiple steps using the gradient estimator \u2207\u0302WtL(Wt,Dc) derived from \u2206L(Wt, \u03b4k;Dc) via Eq. (6), and upload model updates to the server. 3.3 CONVERGENCE ANALYSES: Now we analyze the convergence rate of our gradient estimation method. For continuously differentiable loss functions, we have\u2207WL(W;D) = lim\u03c3\u21920\u2207WL\u03c3(W;D), so we choose a relatively small value for \u03c3. The convergence guarantee can be derived as follows: Theorem 1. (Proof in Appendix A.2) For perturbations {\u03b4k}Kk=1 iid\u223c N (0, \u03c32I), the empirical covariance matrix is \u03a3\u0302 := 1K\u03c32 \u2211K k=1 \u03b4k\u03b4 T k and mean is \u03b4\u0302 := 1 K \u2211K k=1 \u03b4k. Then for any W \u2208 Rn, the relation between \u2207\u0302WL(W;D) and the true gradient\u2207WL(W;D) can be written as \u2207\u0302WL(W;D) = \u03a3\u0302\u2207WL(W;D) + o(\u03b4\u0302); s.t. E[\u03a3\u0302] = I, E[\u03b4\u0302] = 0, (8) where \u03c3 is a small value and the central difference scheme in Eq. (3) holds. When expectation is applied to both sides of Eq. (8), we obtain E[\u2207\u0302WL(W;D)] = \u2207WL(W;D), which degrades to Stein\u2019s identity. To determine the convergence rate w.r.t. the value of K, we have Theorem 2. (Proof in Appendix A.3) The empirical covariance matrix \u03a3\u0302 and mean \u03b4\u0302 converge to the identity matrix I and zero-vector 0 with rate O ( 1\u221a K ) . For a given server model, the number of parameters n is a constant, so we can conclude that \u2207\u0302WL(W;D) provides an unbiased estimation for the true gradients with convergence rateO ( 1\u221a K ) . 4 EXPERIMENTS: We evaluate the performance of BAFFLE on the MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) and CIFAR10/100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) datasets. To simulate FL scenarios, we set the client number C = 10 and use the IID participation (Caldas et al., 2018b) to build local training dataset. We consider two models: 1) LeNet (LeCun et al., 1998) with two convolutional layers as the shallow model (2.7\u00d7 104 parameters) and 2) WideResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) with width = 10 and depth = 2 (WRN-10-2) as the deep model (3.0\u00d7 105 parameters). As results, we report Top-1 accuracy for MNIST and CIFAR-10 and Top-5 accuracy for CIFAR-100. 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS: Training strategies and hyper-parameter settings. Following the settings in Section 2.1, we use federated average to aggregate gradients from multiple clients and use SGD-based optimizer to update global parameters. Specifically, we use Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with \u03b2 = (0.9, 0.99), learning rate 0.01 and epochs 20 for MNIST; and use SGD with momentum 0.9, learning rate 0.1 and epochs 40 for CIFAR-10/100. In BAFFLE, the perturbation scale \u03c3 and number K are the most important hyperparameters. As shown in Theorem 1, with less noise and more samples, the BAFFLE will obtain more accurate gradients, leading to improved performance. However, there exists a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency: an extremely small \u03c3 will cause the underflow problem (Goodfellow et al., 2016) and a large K will increase computational cost. In practice, we empirically set \u03c3 = 10\u22124 because it is the smallest value that does not cause numerical problems in all experiments, and works well on edge devices with half-precision floating-point numbers. We also evaluate the impact of K across a broad range from 100 to 5000. Guidelines for enhancing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in BAFFLE. For a general family of continuously differentiable models, we analyze their convergence rate of BAFFLE in Section 3.3. Since deep networks are usually stacked with multiple linear layers and non-linear activation, this layer linearity can be utilized to improve the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Combining the linearity property and the unique conditions in edge devices (e.g., small data size and half-precision format), we present four guidelines for model design and training that can increase accuracy while maintaining the same computational costs (for the details of linearity analysis, see Appendix C): \u2022 Using twice forward difference (twice-FD) scheme rather than central scheme. Combining difference scheme Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), we find that by executing twice as many forward inferences (i.e.W \u00b1 \u03b4), the central scheme achieves lower residuals than twice-FD, despite the fact that twice-FD can benefit from additional sample times. With the same forward times (e.g., 2K), determining which scheme performs better is a practical issue. As shown in Appendix C, we find that twice-FD performs better in all experiments, in part because the linearity reduces the benefit from second-order residuals. \u2022 Using Hardswish in BAFFLE. ReLU is effective when the middle features (h(\u00b7) denotes the feature mapping) have the same sign before and after perturbations, i.e. h(W+\u03b4) \u00b7h(W) > 0. Due to the fact that ReLU is not differentiable at zero, the value jump occurs when the sign of features changes after perturbations, i.e. h(W + \u03b4) \u00b7 h(W) < 0. We use Hardswish (Howard et al., 2019) as an alternative to overcome this problem since it is continuously differentiable at zero and easy to implement on edge devices. \u2022 Using exponential moving average (EMA) to reduce oscillations. As shown in Theorem 1, there exists an zero-mean white-noise \u03b4\u0302 between the true gradient and our estimation. To smooth out the oscillations caused by white noise, we apply EMA strategies from BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) to the global parameters, with a smoothing coefficient of 0.995. \u2022 Using GroupNorm as opposed to BatchNorm. On edge devices, the dataset size is typically small, which leads to inaccurate batch statistics estimation and degrades performance when using BatchNorm. Thus we employ GroupNorm (Wu & He, 2020) to solve this issue. 4.2 PERFORMANCE ON CLEAN DATA: Following the settings and training strategies described in Section 4.1, we evaluate the performance of BAFFLE by selecting different values of K and comparing the classification accuracy for each K. We reproduce all experiments on the backpropagation-based FL systems with the same settings and use them as the ground truth. We refer to the ground truth results as exact gradients and report the training process of BAFFLE in Figure 2. The results indicate that BAFFLE achieves comparable performance to exact gradients results with a reasonable value K (e.g., 200 for LeNet and 500 for WRN-10-2), which is significantly less than the dimensions of parameter space (e.g., 2.7\u00d7 104 for LeNet and 3 \u00d7 105 for WRN-10-2). Since CIFAR-10 requires a larger K value than MNIST, we conclude that the optimal K value depends on the dataset\u2019s complexity. In addition, because the convergence rate to the exact gradient isO( 1\u221a K ), the marginal benefit of increasing K decreases. For instance, increasing K from 2000 to 5000 on CIFAR-10 with WRN-10-2 barely improves accuracy by 2%. Given that the convergence rate of normal distribution is O( 1\u221a K ), we hypothesize that the sampling efficiency can be improved by choosing an alternative distribution for perturbations. Ablation studies. As depicted in Figure 3, we conduct ablation studies for BAFFLE to evaluate the aforementioned guidelines. In general, twice-FD, Hardswish and EMA can all improve the accuracy. For two difference schemes, we compare the twice-FD to central scheme with the same computation cost and show that the former outperforms the later, demonstrating that linearity reduces the gain from second-order residuals. As to activation functions, Hardswish is superior to ReLU and SELU because it is differentiable at zero and vanishes to zero in the negative part. Moreover, EMA enhances the performance of training strategies by reducing the effect of white noise. 4.3 ROBUSTNESS TO ATTACKS LAUNCHED BY MALICIOUS CLIENTS: Now, we examine the resistance to white-box and inference attacks launched by malicious clients. Recent works exploit TEE to protect models from white-box attacks (Kim et al., 2020), which can defend against white-box attacks by preventing model exposure. However, due to the security guarantee, the usable memory of TEE is usually small (Truong et al., 2021) (e.g., 90MB on Intel SGX for Skylake CPU (McKeen et al., 2016)), which is typically far less than what a backpropagationbased FL system requires (e.g., \u2265 5GB for VGG-16 (Gao et al., 2020)). Since our BAFFLE only requires forward, we assert that BAFFLE can execute in TEE because it requires little memory. In general, we exploit model inference techniques in TEE (Kim et al., 2020; Tramer & Boneh, 2019) by slicing the computation graph and executing the per-layer forward calculation with constrained memory. We refer to Appendix B for details regarding the BAFFLE execution pipeline in TEE. Membership inference attack and model inversion attack are two methods that require an attacker to be able to repeatedly perform model inference on specified data and obtain the results, such as confidence values or classification scores (Shokri et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020). Given that BAFFLE provides stochastic loss differences \u2206L(W, \u03b4;D) associated with the random perturbation \u03b4, we assert that it is difficult to perform inference attacks on BAFFLE. To illustrate this, we select random samples from the validation dataset and generate random input pairs as (X\u0303, y\u0303). As demonstrated in Figure 4, it is difficult to distinguish between real data and random noise, indicating that attackers cannot obtain any useful information from BAFFLE\u2019s outputs. 4.4 COMMUNICATION EFFICIENCY: Throughout the communication round of BAFFLE, each client uploads a K-dim vector to the server and downloads the updated global parameters. Since K is much less than the parameter amounts (e.g., 500 compared to 0.3 million), we assert that our BAFFLE reduces data transfer by roughly half when compared to the FedSGD pipeline in backpropagation-based FL system. As to the epoch-level communication settings, the prevalent FL system requires each client to perform model optimization on the local training dataset and upload the model updates to the server after a number of local epochs in order to reduce communication costs. We demonstrate that BAFFLE can also communicate at the epoch level with O(n) additional memory. In the specifics, we employ an additional memory to store the perturbation in each forward process and estimate the local gradient using Eq. (6). After several epochs, each client optimizes the local model with SGD and uploads local updates. As seen in Table 1, we evaluate the performance of BAFFLE under one-epoch communication settings. Compared to the backpropagation-based FL, we achieve good performance with relatively modest value of K. 5 RELATED WORK: Along the research routine of FL, many efforts have been devoted to, e.g., dealing with non-IID distributions (Zhao et al., 2018; Sattler et al., 2019; Eichner et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020b; Li et al., 2020b), multi-task learning (Smith et al., 2017; Marfoq et al., 2021), and preserving privacy of clients (Bonawitz et al., 2016; 2017b; McMahan et al., 2018; Truex et al., 2019; Hao et al., 2019; Lyu et al., 2020; Ghazi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b). Below we introduce the work on efficiency and vulnerability in FL following the survey of Kairouz et al. (2021), which is more related to this paper. Efficiency in FL. It is widely understood that the communication and computational efficiency is a primary bottleneck for deploying FL in practice (Wang et al., 2019b; Rothchild et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Balakrishnan et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). Specifically, communicating between the server and clients could be potentially expensive and unreliable. The seminal work of Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al. (2016) introduces sparsification and quantization to reduce the communication cost, where several theoretical works investigate the optimal trade-off between the communication cost and model accuracy (Zhang et al., 2013; Braverman et al., 2016; Han et al., 2018; Acharya et al., 2020; Barnes et al., 2020). Since practical clients usually have slower upload than download bandwidth, much research interest focuses on gradient compression (Suresh et al., 2017; Alistarh et al., 2017; Horv\u00e1th et al., 2019; Basu et al., 2019). On the other hand, different methods have been proposed to reduce the computational burden of local clients (Caldas et al., 2018a; Hamer et al., 2020; He et al., 2020), since these clients are usually edge devices with limited resources. Training paradigms exploiting tensor factorization in FL can also achieve promising performance (Kim et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019). Vulnerability in FL. The characteristic of decentralization in FL is beneficial to protecting data privacy of clients, but in the meanwhile, providing white-box accessibility of model status leaves flexibility for malicious clients to perform poisoning/backdoor attacks (Bhagoji et al., 2019; Bagdasaryan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Xie et al., 2020; Pang et al., 2021), model/gradient inversion attacks (Zhang et al., 2020; Geiping et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021), and membership inference attacks (Shokri et al., 2017; Nasr et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2021). To alleviate the vulnerability in FL, several defense strategies have been proposed via selecting reliable clients (Kang et al., 2020), data augmentation (Borgnia et al., 2021), update clipping (Sun et al., 2019), robust training (Li et al., 2021), model perturbation (Yang et al., 2022), detection methods (Seetharaman et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2021), and methods based on differential privacy (Wei et al., 2020), just to name a few. 6 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Backpropagation is the gold standard for training deep networks, and it is also utilized by traditional FL systems. However, backpropagation is unsuited for edge devices due to their limited resources and possible lack of reliability. Using zero-order optimization techniques, we explore the possibility of backpropagation-free FL in this paper. We need to specify that there are scenarios in which clients are fully trusted and have sufficient computing and storage resources. In these situations, traditional FL with backpropagation is preferred over BAFFLE. While our preliminary studies on BAFFLE have generated encouraging results, there are still a number of tough topics to investigate: (i) Compared to the models trained using exact gradients, the accuracy of models trained using BAFFLE is inferior. One reason is that we select small values of K (e.g., 500) relative to the number of model parameters (e.g., 3.0 \u00d7 105); another reason is that gradient descent is designed for exact gradients, whereas our noisy gradient estimation may require advanced learning algorithms. (ii) The empirical variance of zero-order gradient estimators affects training convergence in BAFFLE. It is crucial to research variance reduction approaches, such as control variates and non-Gaussian sampling distributions. (iii) Stein\u2019s identity is proposed for loss functions with Gaussian noises imposed on model parameters. Intuitively, this smoothness is related to differential privacy in FL, but determining their relationship requires theoretical derivations. A PROOFS: A.1 PROOF OF STEIN\u2019S IDENTITY We recap the proof of Stein\u2019s identity following He et al. (2022), where \u2207WL\u03c3(W;D) = \u2207WE\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I)L(W + \u03b4;D) = (2\u03c0)\u2212 n 2 \u00b7 \u2207W \u222b L(W + \u03b4;D) \u00b7 exp ( \u2212\u2225\u03b4\u2225 2 2 2\u03c32 ) d\u03b4 = (2\u03c0)\u2212 n 2 \u00b7 \u222b L(W\u0303;D) \u00b7 \u2207W exp ( \u2212\u2225W\u0303 \u2212W\u2225 2 2 2\u03c32 ) dW\u0303 = (2\u03c0)\u2212 n 2 \u00b7 \u222b L(W\u0303;D) \u00b7 W\u0303 \u2212W \u03c32 \u00b7 exp ( \u2212\u2225W\u0303 \u2212W\u2225 2 2 2\u03c32 ) dW\u0303 = (2\u03c0)\u2212 n 2 \u00b7 \u222b L(W + \u03b4;D) \u00b7 \u03b4 \u03c32 \u00b7 exp ( \u2212\u2225\u03b4\u2225 2 2 2\u03c32 ) d\u03b4 = E\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I) [ \u03b4 \u03c32 L(W + \u03b4;D) ] . (9) By symmetry, we change \u03b4 to \u2212\u03b4 and obtain \u2207WL\u03c3(W;D) = \u2212E\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I) [ \u03b4 \u03c32 L(W \u2212 \u03b4;D) ] , (10) and further we prove that \u2207WL\u03c3(W;D) = 1 2 ( E\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I) [ \u03b4 \u03c32 L(W + \u03b4;D) ] \u2212 E\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I) [ \u03b4 \u03c32 L(W \u2212 \u03b4;D) ]) = E\u03b4\u223cN (0,\u03c32I) [ \u03b4 2\u03c32 \u2206L(W, \u03b4;D) ] . A.2 PROOF OF THEOREM 1 We rewrite the format of \u2207\u0302WL(W;D) as follows: \u2207\u0302WL(W;D) = 1 K K\u2211 k=1 [ \u03b4k 2\u03c32 \u2206L(W, \u03b4k;D)] = 1 K K\u2211 k=1 [ \u03b4k 2\u03c32 ( 2\u03b4\u22a4k \u2207WL(W;D) + o(\u2225\u03b4k\u222522) ) ] (using central scheme in Eq. (3)) = 1 K\u03c32 K\u2211 k=1 [\u03b4k\u03b4 \u22a4 k ]\u2207WL(W;D) + 1 K K\u2211 k=1 \u03b4k 2\u03c32 o(\u2225\u03b4k\u222522) = \u03a3\u0302\u2207WL(W;D) + 1 K K\u2211 k=1 \u03b4k 2\u03c32 o(\u2225\u03b4k\u222522). (11) Then we prove 1K \u2211K k=1 \u03b4k 2\u03c32 o(\u2225\u03b4k\u2225 2 2) = o(\u03b4\u0302). Suppose \u03b4k = (\u03b4k,1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4k,n), then we have \u2225\u03b4k\u222522 \u03c32 = \u2211n i=1( \u03b4k,i \u03c3 ) 2. Since \u2200i, \u03b4k,i\u03c3 \u223c N (0, 1), we have \u2225\u03b4k\u222522 \u03c32 \u223c \u03c7 2(n) and E(\u2225\u03b4k\u2225 2 2 \u03c32 ) = n. So with high probability, o(\u2225\u03b4k\u2225 2 2) \u03c32 = o(n). Substituting it into Eq. (11), we have with high probability, 1 K K\u2211 k=1 \u03b4k 2\u03c32 o(\u2225\u03b4k\u222522) = \u03b4\u0302 \u00b7 o(n) = o(\u03b4\u0302), where we regard n as a constant for a given model architecture. Finally, we prove E[\u03b4\u0302] = 0 and E[\u03a3\u0302] = I. It is trivial that E[\u03b4\u0302] = 0 since \u03b4\u0302 \u223c N (0, 1K\u03c32 I). For E[\u03a3\u0302] = I, we refer to the proof in the following Appendix A.3. A.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 2 We prove the convergence rate of \u03a3\u0302 is at least O ( 1\u221a K ) below. The convergence rate of \u03b4\u0302 can be proved similarly. Let {\u03b4k}Kk=1 be a set of n-dim i.i.d. random variables, each of which is distributed as N (0, \u03c32I). We first show that the estimator \u03a3\u0302 = 1K\u03c32 \u2211K k=1 \u03b4k\u03b4 \u22a4 k has expectation E[\u03a3\u0302] = I. This can be observed by examining each of its entries \u03a3\u0302[ij] = 1 K\u03c32 K\u2211 k=1 \u03b4k[i]\u03b4k[j] = 1 K K\u2211 k=1 \u03b4k[i] \u03c3 \u03b4k[j] \u03c3 , (12) where we have used subscripts [ij] and [i] to denote the usual indexing of matrices and vectors. Specifically, for diagonal entries (i.e., i = j), we observe K \u00b7 \u03a3\u0302[ii] = \u2211K k=1 ( \u03b4k[i] \u03c3 )2 distributes as \u03c72(K), which means E[\u03a3\u0302[ii]] = 1 = I[ii] and Var[\u03a3\u0302[ii]] = 2K ; for non-diagonal entries (i.e., i \u0338= j), we have E[\u03a3\u0302[ij]] = 1K \u2211K k=1 E [ \u03b4k[i] \u03c3 \u03b4k[j] \u03c3 ] = 1K \u2211K k=1 E[\u03b4k[i]] \u03c3 E[\u03b4k[j]] \u03c3 = 0 = I[ij], due to the independence between different dimensions in \u03b4k. With simple calculation, we further have Var[\u03a3\u0302[ij]]= 1 K2 K\u2211 k=1 Var [ \u03b4k[i] \u03c3 \u03b4k[j] \u03c3 ] = 1 K2 K\u2211 k=1 ( Var [ \u03b4k[i] \u03c3 ] Var [ \u03b4k[j] \u03c3 ] +E [ \u03b4k[i] \u03c3 ]2 Var [ \u03b4k[j] \u03c3 ] +Var [ \u03b4k[i] \u03c3 ] E [ \u03b4k[j] \u03c3 ]2) = 1 K . We have shown that for all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, \u03a3\u0302[ij] is an unbiased estimator of I[ij] and has a variance of at most 2K . By Chebyshev\u2019s inequality, \u2200\u03f5 > 0, we have Pr (\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03a3\u0302[ij] \u2212 I[ij]\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u2265 2K \u00b7 n2\u03f5 ) \u2264 \u03f5n2 . With the union bound, we have Pr (\u2225\u2225\u2225\u03a3\u0302\u2212 I\u2225\u2225\u22252 F \u2265 2K \u00b7 n4 \u03f5 ) \u2264 \u03f5. Thus, \u2200\u03f5 > 0, \u2203C > 0 such that Pr (\u2225\u2225\u2225\u03a3\u0302\u2212 I\u2225\u2225\u2225 F \u2265 C \u00b7 1\u221a K ) \u2264 \u03f5. (13) B TRUSTED EXECUTION ENVIRONMENTS: A trusted execution environment (TEE) (Sabt et al., 2015) is regarded as the ultimate solution for defending against all white-box attacks by preventing any model exposure. TEE protects both data and model security with three components: physical secure storage to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and tamper-resistance of stored data; a root of trust to load trusted code; and a separate kernel to execute code in an isolated environment, as illustrated in Figure 5. Using TEE, the FL system is able to train deep models without revealing any model specifics. However, due to the security guarantee, the usable memory of TEE is typically small (Truong et al., 2021) (e.g., 90MB on Intel SGX for Skylake CPU (McKeen et al., 2016)), which is considerably less than what deep models require for backpropagation (e.g., \u2265 5GB for VGG-16 (Gao et al., 2020)). C CONVERGENCE ANALYSES OF DEEP LINEAR NETWORKS IN BAFFLE: We analyze the convergence of BAFFLE in Section 3.3 using a general technique applicable to any continuously differentiable models corresponding to the loss function L(W;D). Since deep networks are the most prevalent models in FL, which has strong linearity, it is simpler to investigate the convergence of deep linear networks (Saxe et al., 2013). Consider a two-layer deep linear network in a classification task with L categories. We denote the model parameters as {W1,W2}, where in the first layer W1 \u2208 Rn\u00d7m, in the second layer W2 \u2208 RL\u00d7n consists of L vectors related to the L categories as {wl2}Ll=1 and wc2 \u2208 R1\u00d7n. For the input data X \u2208 Rm\u00d71 with label y, we train the deep linear network by maximizing the classification score on the y-th class. Since there is no non-linear activation in deep linear networks, the forward inference can be represented as h = wy2W1X, and the loss is \u2212h. It is easy to show that \u2202h \u2202wy2 = (W1X) \u22a4 and \u2202h\u2202W1 = (Xw y 2) \u22a4. We sample \u03b41, \u03b42 from noise generator N (0, \u03c32I), where \u03b41 \u2208 Rn\u00d7m and \u03b42 \u2208 R1\u00d7n. Let h(\u03b41, \u03b42) := (wy2 + \u03b42)(W1 + \u03b41)X, we discover that the BAFFLE estimation in Eq. (6) follows the same pattern for both forward (2) and central schemes (3): \u2206forh(\u03b41, \u03b42) := h(\u03b41, \u03b42)\u2212 h(0,0); \u2206ctrh(\u03b41, \u03b42) := h(\u03b41, \u03b42)\u2212 h(\u2212\u03b41,\u2212\u03b42); \u2206forh(\u03b41, \u03b42) \u03c32 = \u2206ctrh(\u03b41, \u03b42) 2\u03c32 = 1 \u03c32 (wc2\u03b41X+ \u03b42W1X). (14) This equivalent form in deep linear networks illustrates that the residual benefit from the central scheme is reduced by the linearity, hence the performance of the two finite difference schemes described above is same in deep linear networks. We refer to this characteristic as FD scheme independence. We also find the property of \u03c3 independence, that is, the choice of \u03c3 does not effect the results of finite difference, due to the fact that \u03b41\u03c3 and \u03b42 \u03c3 follow the standard normal distribution. Based on the findings from Eq. (14), we propose the following useful guideline that improves accuracy under the same computation cost: Using twice forward difference (twice-FD) scheme rather than central scheme. Combining the forward scheme (2) and central scheme (3), we find that the central scheme produces smaller residuals than the forward scheme by executing twice as many forward inferences, i.e. W \u00b1 \u03b4. With the same forward inference times (e.g., 2K), one practical difficulty is to identify which scheme performs better. We find that the forward scheme performs better in all experiments, in part because the linearity reduces the benefit from second-order residuals, as demonstrated by Eq. (14)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will create three agent reviews for the paper \"Does Federated Learning Really Need Backpropagation?\".

The core idea is intriguing \u2013 replacing backpropagation with multiple forward passes to estimate gradients \u2013 and directly addresses a key challenge in deploying federated learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices: the computational cost and memory demands of backpropagation.  However, the paper\\'s claims regarding edge device suitability require a more rigorous and nuanced evaluation.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n* **Novel Approach:** The core concept of using multiple forward passes to approximate gradients is novel and tackles a significant bottleneck in edge FL.  This deserves recognition for its originality.\\n* **Potential for Reduced Memory Footprint:**  Eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations during backpropagation could significantly reduce memory consumption, a critical factor for edge devices.  The paper should explicitly quantify this memory reduction with empirical results across different edge device profiles (e.g., varying RAM and processing power).\\n* **Focus on Resource Constraints:** The paper directly addresses the limitations of edge devices, a significant contribution to the field of FL.\\n* **Potential for Improved Communication Efficiency (if realized):** Depending on the specifics of the forward pass design, BAFFLE might offer benefits in communication by transmitting smaller gradient updates. This needs further clarification and experimental validation.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n* **Lack of Rigorous Edge Device Evaluation:** The paper\\'s claim of suitability for edge devices needs stronger validation.  While the authors mention resource constraints, the experiments lack concrete examples on real-world edge devices with diverse hardware specifications. Benchmarks should include a comparison against standard FL methods on various resource-constrained platforms (e.g., microcontrollers, mobile phones with limited resources) and clearly quantify the performance gains (or losses) in terms of latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.  Synthetic datasets are insufficient; real-world datasets deployed on representative edge hardware are crucial.\\n* **Accuracy Trade-off:** A crucial concern is the accuracy trade-off.  The paper needs to demonstrate that the gradient approximation achieved by BAFFLE is sufficiently accurate to prevent a significant drop in model performance compared to backpropagation-based FL.  A comprehensive analysis of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off across different datasets and network architectures is essential.\\n* **Communication Overhead:**  The paper needs to provide a detailed analysis of communication overhead.  While the number of parameters might be reduced, the number of forward passes required for accurate gradient estimation could increase the communication load. This trade-off needs thorough investigation.\\n* **Scalability:** The paper should evaluate the scalability of BAFFLE as the number of edge devices and the model complexity increase.  Edge deployments often involve a large number of heterogeneous devices, and the algorithm\\'s ability to handle this heterogeneity needs to be assessed.\\n* **Limited Experimental Setup:**  The paper needs to expand its experimental analysis to include a wider range of hyperparameters, datasets, and network architectures. The current evaluation is limited and doesn\\'t sufficiently demonstrate the generalizability of BAFFLE.\\n\\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\\n\\n* Conduct comprehensive experiments on a diverse range of real-world edge devices.\\n* Quantify the memory footprint reduction, energy consumption, and latency improvements.\\n* Provide a thorough analysis of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.\\n* Analyze the communication overhead and scalability of the proposed method.\\n* Compare BAFFLE against state-of-the-art FL methods specifically designed for edge devices.\\n\\n\\n**Final Decision:**\\n\\nGiven the significant weaknesses in the experimental evaluation and the lack of convincing evidence of superior performance on edge devices, I recommend **Reject** for ICLR 2023.
