The paper title is: Versatile Neural Processes for Learning Implicit Neural Representations\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: A recent line of research on learning representations is to model a signal (e.g., image, 3D scene) as a continuous function that map the input coordinates into the corresponding signal values. By parameterizing a continuous function with neural networks, such implicitly defined representations, i.e., implicit neural representations (INRs), offer many benefits over conventional discrete (e.g., grid-based) representations, such as the compactness and memory-efficiency (Sitzmann et al., 2020b; Tancik et al., 2020; Mildenhall et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a). Characterizing/parameterizing a signal by a corresponding set of network parameters generally requires re-training the neural network, which is computationally costly. In practice, at test time, it is desired to have models that support fast adaptation to partial observations of a new signal without finetuning. In fact, the Neural Processes (NPs) family (Jha et al., 2022) supports such merit. It meta-learns the implicit neural representations of a probabilistic function conditioned on partial signal observations. During test-time inference, it enables the prediction of the function values at target points within a single forward pass. Naturally, given partial observations of a signal, there exists uncertainty inside its continuous function since there are many possible ways to interpolate these observations (i.e., context set). The NP methods (Garnelo et al., 2018a;b) learn to map a context set of observed input-output pairs to a conditional distribution over functions (with uncertainty modeling). However, it has been observed that NPs are prone to underfit the data distribution. Following the spirits of variational auto-encoders (Kingma & Welling, 2014), Latent NP (Garnelo et al., 2018b) introduces a global latent variable to better capture the uncertainty in the overall structure of the function, which still suffers from the inferior capability for modeling complex signals. Attentive Neural Processes (ANP) (Kim et al., 2019) can further alleviate this issue, which leverages the permutation-invariant attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) to reweight the context points and the target predictions. However, taking each context point as a token, ANP has troubles in processing complex signals that requires abundant context points as condition (e.g., image with high resolution), where the computational cost is very expensive. Moreover, for complex signal, modeling the global structure and uncertainty of the function with a single latent Gaussian variable may be suboptimal. It is worthwhile to explore an efficient framework to excavate the potential of NPs in modeling complex signals.

Figure 1 shows the framework of VNP. Specifically, VNP consists of a bottleneck encoder and a hierarchical latent modulated decoder. The bottleneck encoder powered by the set tokenizer and self-attention blocks encodes the set of context points into fewer and informative context tokens, refraining from high computational cost especially on complex signals while attaining higher modeling capability. At the decoder, we hierarchically learn multiple latent Gaussian variables for jointly modeling the global structure and uncertainty of the function distributions. Particularly, we sample from the latent variables and use them to modulate the parameters of the MLP modules. Our VNP has high expressiveness to complex signals (e.g., 2D images and 3D scenes) and significantly outperforms existing NPs approaches on 1D synthetic data. We summarize our main contributions as below: \u2022 We propose Versatile Neural Processes (VNP) that is capable of learning accurate INRs for approximating the function of a complex signal. \u2022 We introduce a bottleneck encoder to produce compact yet representative context tokens, facilitating the processing of complex signals with tolerable computational complexity. \u2022 We design a hierarchical latent modulated decoder that can better capture and describe the structure and uncertainty of function through the joint modulation from the multiple global latent variables. \u2022 We implement the VNP framework on 1D, 2D, and 3D signals respectively, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. Particularly, our method shows promise in learning accurate INRs of 3D scenes without further finetuning. 2 RELATED WORK: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). INRs aim at parameterizing a signal by a differentiable neural network, i.e., learning a continuous mapping function w.r.t. the signal (Stanley, 2007; Sitzmann et al., 2020b; Tancik et al., 2020). In the seminal work CPPN (Stanley, 2007), a neural network is trained to learn the implicit function that fits a signal, e.g., an image. Given any spatial position identified by a 2D coordinate, the model that acts as a function, outputs the color value of this position. Such continuous representations, as a powerful paradigm, have a wide range of applications such as 2D image super-resolution (Chen et al., 2021b), modeling shapes (Chen & Zhang, 2019; Park et al., 2019) and textures (Oechsle et al., 2019), and 3D scene reconstruction (Mildenhall et al., 2020; Martin-Brualla et al., 2021; Niemeyer & Geiger, 2021). Most of these methods require re-training the neural network to model/overfit a new signal, which is computationally costly (Sitzmann et al., 2020b; Tancik et al., 2020; Mildenhall et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a). In practice, it is desired to have models that support fast adaptation to a new signal, i.e., approaching the continuous function of this signal without abundant steps of optimization in inference. Some works (Chen et al., 2021b; Lee et al., 2021; Sitzmann et al., 2020a) adopt standard gradient-based meta-learning algorithms to learn the initial weight parameters of the network (Finn et al., 2017). However, they still require a few gradient decent steps to fit for the new signals. Neural Processes (NPs). Neural Processes actually can learn the continuous function conditioned on partial observations of a signal, enabling fast adaptation to a new signal (not requiring finetuning in inference). The series of NPs methods (Garnelo et al., 2018a;b) provide probabilistic solutions in predicting continuous functions from partial observations. NPs approximate the distributions in the function space, which formulates Stochastic Processes (Ross et al., 1996), by introducing stochasticity in function realization. A line of researches on neural processes has been introduced, targeting at improving the prediction accuracy (Kim et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Wang & Van Hoof, 2020; Volpp et al., 2021), preserving the stationarity of stochastic processes (Gordon et al.; Foong et al., 2020), and generalizing to observation noise (Kim et al., 2022). Latent NP (Garnelo et al., 2018b) learns a latent variable distribution to capture the global uncertainty in the overall structure of the function, which is optimized with variational inferece (Kingma & Welling, 2014). Attentive Neural Processes (ANP) leverages the attention mechanism to enhance the representation of each context point and alleviate the underfitting problem (Kim et al., 2019). Transformer Neural Processes (TNP) (Nguyen & Grover, 2022) similarly takes each context point as a token and leverages transformer architecture to approximate the function. However, for complex signals that requiring abundant context points as condition (e.g., image with high resolution), the computational complexities of ANP and TNP are very high which are quadratic with respect to the number of context points. It is desired to have a framework that can effectively approximate the functions of complex signals. In this work, we introduce a strong NP framework, Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), which leverages informative context tokens and explores the hierarchical global latent variables for modulation, leading to superior approximation of function distributions. 3 REVISITING THE PROBLEM FORMULATION OF NPS: Neural Processes (NPs) (Garnelo et al., 2018b;a) are a class of methods that approximate the probabilistic distribution of the continuous function conditioned on partial observations. Suppose we have a labeled context set DC = (XC , YC) := (xi,yi)i\u2208C sampled from a continuous function with inputs xi and outputs yi, NPs target at predicting an arbitrary and finite number of target points DT = (XT , YT ) := (xi,yi)i\u2208T by learning the input-output mapping function f . Given some observations (a set of context points) of a signal, many possible functions may match well to these observations and thus naturally there exists uncertainty on the functions. The conditional distributions of targets points can be modeled as: p\u03d5(YT |XT , Dc) = \u220f (x,y)\u2208DT N (y;\u00b5y(x, Dc), \u03c32y(x, Dc)). (1) To generate coherent function predictions and better model the function distributions, Garnelo et al. (Garnelo et al., 2018b) introduce the (Latent) Neural Process by encoding the global structure and uncertainty of the function into a latent Gaussian variable via Bayesian inference: z \u223c p\u03b8(z|XT , DC); p\u03b8(YT |XT , z) = \u220f (x,y)\u2208DT N (y;\u00b5y(z, XT , DC), \u03c32y(z, XT , DC)). (2) Due to the intractable log-likelihood, some previous works adopt amortized variational inference (Kingma & Welling, 2014), which is also used to optimize our proposed framework. We can derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p\u03b8(YT |XT , z), where the ELBO can be viewed as a combination of the reconstruction term (the first term) and the KL term (the second term): Ez\u223cq\u03d5(z|DT )[log p\u03b8(YT |z, XT , DC)]\u2212DKL[q\u03d5(z|DT )||p\u03c8(z|XT , DC)]. (3) Here, \u03c8, \u03d5 and \u03b8 refer to the parameters of conditional prior encoder, conditional posterior encoder and the decoder, similar to conditional VAEs (Sohn et al., 2015; Ivanov et al., 2019). So far, we have revisited the problem formulation of NPs. Since NPs approximate the distribution over functions with some function observations, they can also be regarded as probabilistic, continuous, conditional generative models, where the generation result is a continuous function. 4 VERSATILE NEURAL PROCESSES: We propose an efficient NP framework, Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), which provides much improved capability in approximating the function of a various signal. Figure 1 provides an overview of our proposed VNP. VNP is generic that can be used to generate the functions for 1D, 2D or 3D signals. For test-time inference, the inputs are a set of context points DC = (XC , YC) and the coordinates of target points XT . The outputs are the predicted values of target points YT . The continuous function is parameterized by the network weights. The proposed VNP consists of a bottleneck encoder that efficiently encodes the context points into fewer informative context tokens, refraining from high computational cost especially on complex signals. At the decoder side, crossattention layers are utilized to exploit the contexts relevant to the given target followed by a stack of modulated MLP blocks. Particularly, we introduce multiple global latent variables to jointly modulate the MLP parameters, which facilitates the modeling of complex signal. 4.1 BOTTLENECK ENCODER IN VNP: Some NP methods encode the context points to produce local feature representations at target coordinates. The early work (Garnelo et al., 2018b) uses simple MLP layers to learn features of the context set and suffers from underfitting problem. Attentive NP (Kim et al., 2019) and Transformer NP (Nguyen & Grover, 2022) enhances the feature representation by introducing point-wise selfattention with each context point taken as a token. However, when the number of context points is large (e.g.in order to model an image signal with many details), the computational burden is heavy and such framework is impractical. We address this issue by simply introducing a set tokenization module (set tokenizer) followed by self-attention layers. The set tokenizer is instantiated by a set convolution layer (Zaheer et al., 2017) which transforms the neighboring context points to a token. Taking a 2D image signal as an example, with the kernel size of 10\u00d7 10 and stride of 10, the set tokenizer can reduce the number of tokens by 100 times. Note that the difference between the set convolution and the conventional convolution is that the former can handle missing points (e.g., in the application of inpainting) and the data that live \"off the grid\" (e.g. time series data that observed irregularly at any time). The combination of set tokenizer and attention layers would empower our framework the flexibility in processing 3D signals, which is infeasible for ConvNP (Gordon et al.; Foong et al., 2020). This is because ConvNP requires to preserve all the 3D grids, which would be very inefficient in sparse 3D space. 4.2 HIERARCHICAL LATENT MODULATED MLPS: In the previous NP methods (Garnelo et al., 2018b; Kim et al., 2019), they learn a single global latent Gaussian variable from the observed context set to model the distributions of a function for representing a signal. However, it potentially limits the expressiveness of the model. Intuitively, increasing the dimension of the latent variables may increase such flexibility, but in practice, this is not sufficient (Lee et al., 2020). We design a hierarchical latent modulated decoder in order to better model the complex distribution of a function. We sequentially learn multiple global latent variables to modulate the parameters of MLP blocks. Figure 2 shows the details of the designed hierarchical structure. The decoder consists of Lc cross-attention blocks and LK modulated MLP blocks. With the target location XT as query and the context tokens from encoder as the keys and values, the cross-attention blocks output the target location features Y\u03020 \u2208 RT\u00d7d, where T is the number of target coordinates and d is the feature dimension. The sequential modulated MLP blocks enable the exploitation of hierarchical global latent variables for the approximation of a complex signal. The output of the final (LK -th) modulated MLP block goes through two extra MLP layers to estimate the probability of YT . Figure 2b illustrates the detailed network structure of a modulated MLP block. At the heart of each block is a latent variable z \u2208 R1\u00d7dz modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The generation process of zk (of the kth block) can be formulated as follows: p\u03c8(zk|Y\u0302<k, DC , XT ) = N (\u00b5zk , \u03c32zk)\u2190 MLPs (AvgPool (MLPs(Y\u0302k\u22121))), (4) Here, MLPs refer to two MLP layers and an intermediate ReLU activation layer. The prediction results Yk\u22121 from the previous block (i.e., the (k \u2212 1)th block) will participate in calculating the conditional prior distribution of zk, i.e., p\u03c8(zk|Y\u0302<k, DC , XT ). During training, the conditional posterior distribution q\u03d5(zk|Y\u0302<k,DC,DT) can be calculated as well, by incorporating the ground truth target signal values YT: q\u03d5(zk|Y\u0302<k, DC , DT ) = N (\u00b5zk , \u03c32zk)\u2190 MLPs (AvgPool (MLPs([Y\u0302k\u22121,DT]))). (5) As marked with dashed lines in our figures, YT will only participate in training (z samples from q\u03d5) and will not be accessed during inference (z samples from p\u03c8). After achieving the low-dimensional latent variable zk, we use the modulated fully-connected (ModFC) layer (Karras et al., 2020; 2021) to adjust the inherent MLPs parameters, taking a sampled realization of zk as the style vector input. Unlike previous NP methods that concatenate the latent variable to every target coordinate, modulating the MLP parameters from the low-dimensional latent variables is a more flexible way to represent continuous functions (Sitzmann et al., 2020b). These modulated MLPs together with some unmodulated MLPs will enhance Y\u0302k\u22121, and output the refined function features Y\u0302k, which will be sent as the input of the next block. We only modulate some of the MLPs to preserve the training stability. In short, we model the function representations by multiple latent variables, z = (z1, z2, ..., zLK). The KL term in Eq. 3, which measures the mismatch between the approximated distribution and ground truth distribution, takes the hierarchical format as DKL = LK\u2211 i=k DKL[q\u03d5(zk|Y\u0302<k, DC , DT )||p\u03c8(zk|Y\u0302<k, DC , XT )]. (6) This decomposed KL term together with the original reconstruction term formulates our final optimization objective in Eq. 7. In our experiments on 2D and 3D signals, we multiply the KL term with a small weight \u03b2 to better capture the uncertainty of function distributions (Higgins et al.). L = Ez\u223cq\u03d5(z|DT )[\u2212 log p\u03b8(YT |z,XT , DC)] + \u03b2 \u00b7DKL (7) In addition, we emphasize that although there are some prior works designing hierarchical architecture for VAEs (S\u00f8nderby et al., 2016; Vahdat & Kautz, 2020; Child, 2021) or double latent variable models for NP (Wang & Van Hoof, 2020), our proposed hierarchical architecture is different in principle. Here, every latent variable is a low-dimensional vector obtained after average pooling. Therefore, the designed hierarchical architecture can deal with arbitrary target coordinates and thereby can be used for boosting the performance of approximating the global structure of continuous functions. 5 EXPERIMENTS: The proposed Versatile Neural Process (VNP), as an efficient meta-learner of implicit neural representations, can be implemented into a variety of tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of VNP on 1D function regression (subsection 5.1), 2D image completion and superresolution (subsection 5.2), and view synthesis for 3D scenes (subsection 5.3), respectively. 5.1 1D SIGNAL REGRESSION: We implement the proposed VNP to learn the implicit neural representations for 1D signal regression. This classical 1D regression aims at predicting the function values at given target locations, conditioned on several observations of the samples from the function. Following (Kim et al., 2019), we measure the performance by considering the context set likelihood and target set likelihood, which reflects the context reconstruction error and target prediction error, respectively. Settings. We train the models on synthetic functions drawn from prior function distributions synthesized with different kernels (RBF, Matern) by following (Gordon et al.; Kim et al., 2022). For all the evaluated methods, we employ importance weighted sampling (Burda et al., 2016) to evaluate the log likelihood. For fair comparison, we manage to keep the network size comparable with that of other methods, which is completed by adjusting the number of channels in VNP. Please refer to Appendix A for detailed experimental settings. Comparison with the State-of-the-Arts. We compare our method with conditional neural process (CNP) (Garnelo et al., 2018a), (stacked) attentive neural process (ANP) (Kim et al., 2019), bootstrapping attentive neural process (BANP) (Lee et al., 2020), and convolutional neural process (ConvNP) (Foong et al., 2020). Table 1 shows the results in terms of log likelihood values. Most of the models can provide satisfactory reconstruction results for context points, except CNP which suffers from underfitting problem (Garnelo et al., 2018b). On the context points, ours also achieves comparable performance. However, the prediction results of other methods on the unseen target points are much worse than that on the context sets. In contrast, our our final model, VNP, outperforms previous approaches by a large margin at the target points on both of the function distributions. Note that although BANP attempts to increase the expressiveness of function representations by using latent variable bootstrapping from the perspective data resampling. Ablation Study. We conduct a group of ablation study on this 1D regression task to investigate the effectiveness of different components. Based on ANP, we first build a Hierarchical Neural Process (HNP) with hierarchical latent variables. Note that similar to ANP, the implemented HNP still concatenates every target coordinate with the global latent variables. We observe significant improvements in Table 1 by comparing HNP with ANP, demonstrating that the hierarchical global latent variables boost the performance of function approximation. Secondly, the modulated MLP layer for implicit function parameterization can be further equipped in HNP, referred to as HNPMod. Compared with the concatenation of latent variable, using low-dimensional latent variables to modulate the network parameters enables more flexible function approximating. Based on HNP-Mod, we finally add the bottleneck encoder to learn conditional network inputs that are adaptive to target locations, building our final model VNP. In Table 1, we can find this powerful pre-processing encoder can further improve the performance, because the set tokenizer (set convolution here) can preserve locality to learn more appropriate features. In Table 2, we further ablate on the detailed hierarchical structures in our model. As we can observe, when we increase the number of hierarchical blocks, the prediction performance (at target points) will be improved until saturated with 6 blocks. If we further increase the block number, the training period will be unstable and results in larger variance. In addition, the column with \"6 / single z\" means we use exactly the same network structures as block=6, but instead only impose the KL constraint to the final latent variable z6. It is found that the performance will also drop dramatically, which verifies that the gains come from the hierarchical design instead of the increased network capacity. This ablation study guides us to set the number of hierarchical block as 6 to compare with other methods, which can keep a balance between the performance and the complexity Visualizations. We visualize the obtained function distributions from stacked ANP (Kim et al., 2019) and our VNP, by sampling the latent variables 20 times. As shown in Figure 3, we can see that the generated functions from the stacked ANP cannot predict the target points accurately, e.g., those regions marked by orange. In contrast, our method provide good approximations for the continuous functions, where the distribution covers the groudtruth function. 5.2 2D IMAGES COMPLETION AND SUPERRESOLUTION: A 2D image can be modeled by a continuous function that maps the 2D pixel coordinates to the color values. We implement our VNP framework for learning the continuous function of 2D images, which supports tasks such as image completion and super-resolution to arbitrary size. Settings. We conduct experiments on CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015), mainly with the resized resolution of 64 \u00d7 64. Due to the limited representation capability or the high requirement on computation resources, most previous NP methods (Kim et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020) are in general trained and evaluated on relatively low resolution such as 32 \u00d7 32. Our framework enables the processing of complex signal with higher resolution. We train a single model that supports image completion and super-resolution tasks. During training, we control the context ratio as 0.1, which means 10% pixels are taken as context set. The target ratio is set as 0.25 and the target set has partial intersection with the context set. More detailed experimental settings can be found in Appendix A. Visualizations. We compare our VNP with stacked ANP (Kim et al., 2019) in testing with three different context ratios respectively as shown in Figure 4. Our VNP generates diverse and realistic image completion results with fine details. In comparison, the results of Stacked ANP are blurred. We also conduct the similar ablation study to investigate the influence of the hierarchical structures, the results of which are shown one the right of Figure 4. Due to the limit of GPU memory, we finally set the number of hierarchical blocks also as 6 for this 2D experiment. In Figure 5, we show that the proposed VNP achieves satisfactory results for image completion and superresolution on CelebA64 dataset. As a unified framework, with a single model, it can support image completion, superresolution, and the concurrent of completion and superresolution. Complexity Comparisons. Thanks to our bottleneck encoder design, the proposed VNP is a practical framework for complex signal modeling, where the number of context points as condition is usually large. For comparison, we calculate the GFLOPs of stacked ANP and our VNP when target ratio is 0.25 on CelebA64 and CelebA178 respectively. The computational complexity comparisons in terms of GFLOPs are shown in Table 3. Since we use set tokenlizer to reduce the number of tokens and process the context set in image grids, the GFLOPs of VNP would be smaller than that of Stacked ANP, especially when the context ratio is high. 5.3 VIEW SYNTHESIS ON 3D SCENE: Implicit neural representations excel at representing 3D signals. However, since 3D signals are usually much more complex, most previous works (Mildenhall et al., 2020; Martin-Brualla et al., 2021) require expensive optimization to fit the neural networks to represent the scenes. We focus on the task of view synthesis in this section to evaluate our proposed VNP. Settings. We follow the spirits of NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020) that fits a network to map the world coordinate into the corresponding RGB values and volume density. We use bottleneck encoder (tokenization from the image patches) to calculate the adaptive input of the MLPs, queried by target world coordinate. Then the hierarchically learned global latent variable will modulate the parameters of MLPs to predict the RGB values and volume density. Note that there is an extra volume rendering process inside each decoding block before the pooling module, because it requires transferring the world coordinate to the image coordinate to compute the latent distribution of zk. We conduct experiments on ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015) objects, including three sub-dataset: cars, lamps, and chairs. More details on the network structures and hyper parameters can be found in Appendix A. Comparisons. Our VNP model can generate probabilistic implicit neural representations for previous unseen scene in a single forward pass. In this 3D task, one prior work NeRF-VAE (Kosiorek et al., 2021) can also generate the scene from the randomly sampled latent variable. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons with NeRF-VAE. In addition, we compare with another two works (Chen et al., 2021b) and (Chen & Wang, 2022) that learn implicit neural representations for previous unseen scene using a few steps, although they are not in the family of probabilistic models and thus cannot model distributions of function from priors. As shown in Table 4, our method achieves the best performance in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) on Cars and Lamps and comparable performance with Trans-INR (Chen & Wang, 2022) on Chairs. The qualitative comparisons in Figure 6a show that our method VNP produces much better prediction of the novel view than NeRF-VAE. Note that during the optimization, VAE estimates the distribution over the dataset given a sample. In contrast, NPs estimate the conditional distribution over the labels of the target points given the set of labeled context points, which is more adaptive to the signal. 6 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: The Neural Processes family provides an efficient way for learning implicit neural representations by approximating the function distribution when only partial observation of a signal is given. We propose an efficient NP framework, Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), that largely increases the capability of approximating functions. Our bottleneck encoder and hierarchical latent modulated decoder enables strong modeling capability to the complex signals. Through comprehensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed VNP on 1D, 2D and 3D signals. Our work demonstrates the potential of neural process as a promising solution for efficient learning of INRs in complex 3D scenes. APPENDIX A: Here, we provide the detailed hyper parameters used in all the experiments in Table 5. Among them, some hyper parameters denote to, Ls number of self-attention layers in bottleneck encoder, Lc number of cross-attention layers, K number of hierarchical blocks, d the feature dimension through the entire network. The row of Fourier features describes whether we embed the coordinate into high-frequency embeddings as suggested in (Tancik et al., 2020). \u03b2 is the hyper parameter used to balance the losses of reconstruction and KL divergence. The reconstruction term describes how we calculate the reconstruction loss Ez\u223cq\u03d5(z|DT )[\u2212 log p\u03b8(YT |z,XT , DC)]. In addition, when training for 1D synthetic functions, we will randomly sample 5 to 15 context points and 15 to 25 target points on Matern and RBF kernel."}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'ReviewerICLR_A', 'system_prompt': 'You are an ICLR reviewer with expertise in implicit neural representations and meta-learning.

VNP leverages a set tokenizer and self-attention in the encoder to create compact context encodings, and employs a hierarchical latent modulated decoder using multiple latent Gaussian variables to condition MLP module parameters.

The use of a set tokenizer in the encoder to compress context points is also a potentially beneficial design choice for handling variable-size context sets.\n*   **Extensive Experiments:** The experimental section covers a variety of datasets (1D, 2D, and 3D signals) and provides comparisons against several baselines, suggesting a thorough evaluation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Probabilistic Justification for Architecture Choices:** The paper doesn't adequately justify the probabilistic reasoning behind the architecture. While the use of latent variables is standard in Neural Processes, the *specific* hierarchical structure and the way these latent variables modulate the MLP parameters lack clear probabilistic motivation. Why this particular form of modulation? How does it relate to the underlying data distribution? The paper treats the architecture as a black-box neural network without delving into its probabilistic interpretation.\n*   **Limited Novelty in Probabilistic Modeling:** The core probabilistic framework remains relatively standard within the Neural Process literature (Gaussian latent variable model). The main novelty seems to lie in the specific architecture design, which is not sufficiently justified from a probabilistic perspective. The tokenization step, while potentially effective in practice, deviates from the core probabilistic foundation expected in Neural Processes. It's more of an engineering trick than a theoretically grounded innovation.\n*   **Insufficient Ablation Studies:** While the paper presents comparisons to baselines, there is a lack of ablation studies to isolate the impact of each architectural component. For example, how much does the set tokenizer contribute compared to a simpler encoding strategy? What is the effect of the hierarchical latent structure compared to a single latent variable? Without these ablations, it's difficult to assess the true contribution of each component.\n*   **Unclear Details on Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:** The paper lacks sufficient detail on the training procedure, including specific hyperparameters, optimization algorithms, and training schedules. The lack of reproducibility detail is concerning, particularly for a method that claims state-of-the-art performance. A critical aspect missing is a discussion on how the KL regularization is handled and the impact of different KL weighting schemes. The paper should provide justification for the chosen KL weight and its effect on the model's performance.\n*   **Overclaims of State-of-the-Art Performance:** While the paper claims state-of-the-art performance, the results are presented without sufficient statistical significance testing.

While the architectural design is potentially interesting, it lacks a clear connection to the underlying probabilistic principles of Neural Processes. The novelty is incremental, and the experimental validation is insufficient due to the lack of ablation studies, statistical significance testing, and detailed training information. The overclaims of state-of-the-art performance further weaken the paper.

While the idea has merit, the paper in its current form needs significant improvements to warrant acceptance at ICLR.\\n\\n**Recommendation: Reject**\\n', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.0379509975}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': \"## Review: Versatile Neural Processes for Learning Implicit Neural Representations\\n\\nThis paper presents Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), a Neural Process framework for learning implicit neural representations. The key innovations lie in a token-based bottleneck encoder leveraging self-attention and a hierarchical latent-modulated decoder. The reported results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across 1D, 2D, and 3D signal tasks, which is promising.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Strong Performance:** The demonstrated SOTA results on multiple benchmark datasets suggest a practical advantage over existing methods for learning implicit neural representations. This is crucial for driving adoption in real-world applications.\\n*   **Token-based Encoder:** The token-based encoder is an interesting design choice. It potentially offers better scalability compared to methods processing the entire context set directly, which is a key factor for deploying these models on larger and more complex datasets. The use of self-attention is also likely beneficial for capturing long-range dependencies within the context points.\\n*   **Hierarchical Latent Modulation:** Using a hierarchy of latent variables to modulate the decoder's MLP weights is an appealing approach for capturing different levels of abstraction in the data. This could lead to better generalization and robustness to noisy or incomplete data, a critical aspect for real-world applicability.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n*   **Scalability Discussion:** While the paper mentions the advantages of the token-based encoder, it lacks a thorough analysis of the method's scalability with respect to the number of context points or the dimensionality of the input space. Practical impact hinges on the ability to handle large datasets, and this needs to be addressed more explicitly. Include a discussion of the computational complexity of the encoder and decoder.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies should be more focused on demonstrating the impact of the specific design choices (tokenization, hierarchical latent variables). While overall performance is strong, it's crucial to understand the contribution of each component for future research and application.\\n*   **Code Availability:** While not mandatory, releasing the code would significantly increase the impact of the paper and facilitate adoption by the community.\\n\\n**Overall Assessment:**\\n\\nThis paper presents a solid contribution to the field of implicit neural representations with compelling empirical results. The proposed VNP framework shows promise for practical applications due to its strong performance and potentially improved scalability. However, the paper would benefit from a more in-depth discussion of scalability, more targeted ablation studies, and, ideally, code availability.\\n\\n**Decision: Accept (Conditional)**\\n\\nI recommend acceptance contingent upon addressing the following points:\\n\\n1.  **Expand the discussion on scalability.** Quantify the computational complexity of the encoder and decoder and provide empirical evidence (if possible) to support the claim of improved scalability.\\n2.  **Refine the ablation studies** to more clearly demonstrate the impact of the tokenization and hierarchical latent modulation components.\\n3.  **Consider releasing the code** to maximize the impact of the paper.\\n\", 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.0379324675}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'ReviewerICLR_A'}, name='FireAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'ReviewerICLR_B'}, name='FireAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'ReviewerICLR_C'}, name='FireAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Agent successfully fired.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9.0379324675\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `FireAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ReviewerICLR_A\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Agent successfully fired.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9.0379324675\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `FireAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ReviewerICLR_B\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 1, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Agent successfully fired.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9.0379324675\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `FireAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ReviewerICLR_C\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 2, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='FireAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent successfully fired.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.0379324675}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='FireAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent successfully fired.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.0379324675}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='FireAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent successfully fired.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.0379324675}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the three reviews:\n\n*   Reviewer A recommends **Reject** due to incremental novelty, limited ablation studies, missing discussion of computational complexity, and lack of theoretical justification.\n*   Reviewer B recommends **Reject** due to a lack of probabilistic justification for architecture choices, limited novelty in probabilistic modeling, insufficient ablation studies, unclear details on training and hyperparameter tuning, and overclaims of state-of-the-art performance.\n*   Reviewer C recommends **Accept (Conditional)** contingent upon addressing the scalability discussion, refining the ablation studies, and considering releasing the code.\n\nConsidering the concerns raised by two of the reviewers regarding novelty, justification of design choices, and thoroughness of the experimental evaluation, the final decision is:\n\nFINAL DECISION: Reject\n"}], "ground_truth": "Accept: poster", "response_time": 31.622821807861328}
