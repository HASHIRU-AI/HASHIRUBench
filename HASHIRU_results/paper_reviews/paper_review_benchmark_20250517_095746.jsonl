The paper title is: Pre-trained Language Models can be Fully Zero-Shot Learners\n\nNone: How can we extend a pre-trained model to many language understanding tasks, without labeled or additional unlabeled data? Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been effective for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, existing approaches either require fine-tuning on downstream labeled datasets or manually constructing proper prompts. In this paper, we propose nonparametric prompting PLM (NPPrompt) for fully zero-shot language understanding. Unlike previous methods, NPPrompt uses only pre-trained language models and does not require any labeled data or additional raw corpus for further fine-tuning, nor does it rely on humans to construct a comprehensive set of prompt label words. We evaluate NPPrompt against previous major few-shot and zero-shot learning methods on diverse NLP tasks: including text classification, text entailment, similar text retrieval, and paraphrasing. Experimental results demonstrate that our NPPrompt outperforms the previous best fully zero-shot method by big margins, with absolute gains of 12.8% in accuracy on text classification and 18.9% on the GLUE benchmark. 1 INTRODUCTION: Natural language understanding (NLU) has been important in many applications such as intelligent dialog assistants, online search, and social media analysis. Recent advancement of NLU has been driven by emergent pre-trained language models (PLMs) including BERT (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b), GPT (Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Brown et al., 2020), BART (Lewis et al., 2020), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). Prior studies show that PLMs obtain substantial knowledge during pre-training on raw text corpus (Petroni et al., 2019; Feldman et al., 2019). By fine-tuning on taskspecific labeled data, PLMs exploit such knowledge and gain impressive accuracy on a wide range of NLP tasks, such as text classification (Kowsari et al., 2019), question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), machine reading comprehension (Campos et al., 2016), etc. However, fine-tuning approaches are expensive. It requires labeled datasets, which are rarely available for many tasks. Significant computational efforts are needed to update PLMs\u2019 parameters for multiple tasks. In addition, fine-tuning results in one distinct model for each task to maintain. How can we generalize a pre-trained model to many NLP tasks, without labeled or additional unlabeled data? Existing few-shot and zero-shot approaches propose to construct prompts to elicit desired predictions from PLMs (Brown et al., 2020). The main idea of prompting PLMs is to convert an input utterance to one with masked templates. For example, in text classification an input can be \u201cThe Warriors won the NBA championship 2022\u201d and it is instead converted to \u201cA [MASK] news: The Warriors won the NBA championship 2022\u201d. A PLM (e.g. BERT) takes the converted text and produces predictions for the masked token, along with the probability. Ideally, a PLM will generate a higher probability for the word \u201csports\u201d than \u201cpolitics\u201d on the [MASK] token. Although these prompting-based methods are effective, they require unlabeled data for training or huge human efforts to construct prompts and to choose designated tokens to represent class labels (Schick & Schu\u0308tze, 2021a;b; Gao et al., 2021). In addition, these manually constructed verbalizers, i.e. mapping from words (e.g. \u201cbasketball\u201d) to class labels (e.g. SPORTS), do not extend to new emerging categories after PLMs are deployed. In this paper, we investigate the fully zero-shot learning problem for NLU where only the target label names are available but not the extra raw text. We propose nonparametric prompting PLM (NPPrompt), a novel method to generate predictions for semantic labels without any fine-tuning. NPPrompt uses PLM\u2019s own embeddings to automatically find relevant words to labels (e.g. \u201cbasketball\u201d and \u201cNBA\u201d for SPORTS), therefore it does not need humans to construct verbalizers. Our key idea is to search for the top k nearest neighbors to a label name in the embedding manifold and then generate and aggregate PLM\u2019s predicted logits from masked prompts. In the above case, both predicted values for \u201cbasketball\u201d and \u201cNBA\u201d contribute to the final prediction for the SPORTS category. In this way, NPPrompt can be easily generalized to any new categories as long as the category names are semantically meaningful. The contributions of this paper are as follows. a) We develop NPPrompt, a novel method for fully zero-shot learning with PLMs. b) We conduct extensive experiments on diverse language understanding tasks including text classification, text entailment, similar text retrieval, and paraphrasing. Experimental results show that NPPrompt outperforms the previous zero-shot methods by absolute 12.8% in accuracy on text classification and 18.9% on the GLUE benchmark. Surprisingly, NPPrompt is on a par with the best prior method that trained with manual verbalizers, an additional knowledge base, and extra unlabeled data. 2 RELATED WORK: Prompting The success of GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has attracted much attention to prompting engineering, a new way to leverage pre-trained language models. Brown et al. (2020) concatenate a few input and output pairs and feed them to the large-scale GPT-3 language model, which is an intuitive in-context learning paradigm, allowing the model to generate answers for additional cases autoregressively. Recent works (Schick & Schu\u0308tze, 2021a;b) show that small-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and ALBERT (Lan et al., 2019) can also achieve decent performance using prompt-tuning. Prompting has been applied to a large variety of tasks such as Text Classification (Schick & Schu\u0308tze, 2021a), Natural Language Understanding (Schick & Schu\u0308tze, 2021b), Knowledge Probing (Petroni et al., 2019), and Relation Extraction (Han et al., 2021). Typically, a piece of prompt contains a template and a verbalizer. The language model predicts a probability distribution over vocabulary given the template and the verbalizer transforms it into a prediction over class labels. In this work, we focus on designing the verbalizers automatically. Verbalizer Design The verbalizer is an important component in prompting which bridges model outputs and labels and greatly impacts the performance. Schick & Schu\u0308tze (2021a) design human written verbalizers for prompting, however, they are highly biased towards personal vocabulary with inadequate coverage. Apart from manually designed verbalizers, some recent studies explore automatic verbalizer construction. Auto-L (Gao et al., 2021) uses re-ranking to find the label words set by fine-tuning the model on the candidates searched by RoBERTa; AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) applies gradient-based search to create both prompts and label words automatically with a few trigger examples. But these approaches need to update parameters with gradient descent, which turns out to be infeasible without access to the model weights (e.g., GPT-3). KPT (Han et al., 2021) incorporates external knowledge into the verbalizer in which the unlabeled dataset is needed to refine the label words and thus is not applicable to scenarios where only label names are known. In contrast, our approach NPPrompt directly finds, without any gradient update, relevant words to label names with only PLM\u2019s initial word embedding. Zero-shot Text Classification The general zero-shot text classification usually focuses on classifying texts into classes that are unseen during the training process. Transferring knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones requires accurate and discriminative descriptions of all classes (Liu et al., 2019a; Xia et al., 2018), joint embeddings of categories and documents (Nam et al., 2016) or semantic correlations among classes (Rios & Kavuluru, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). However, these methods require supervised data for the known label set and thus cannot be extended to settings where no labeled pairs for any category is available. (Meng et al., 2020) propose the LOTClass model that uses label names with self-training to do zero-shot classification. But LOTClass still requires unlabeled corpus for extracting the topic-related words and performing self-training. In this work, NPPrompt achieves competitive and even better performance without using any unlabeled dataset. 3 BACKGROUND: PROMPT-BASED TUNING FOR PLMS: We first provide a standard paradigms, prompt-based tuning, that perform well in few-shot scenarios, before introducing our approach for the zero-shot case. Take N way text classification as an example. We aim to predict the label y \u2208 Y for each sentence, where Y is the label set with N distinct classes. Prompt-based tuning tunes PLM using customized prompts (Brown et al., 2020). The regular prompt-based tuning converts a specific task to a cloze-style mask language modeling problem. For each input example x (single sentence or sentence pair), we first apply a task template T on it, converting original input x to xprompt. For instance, we concatenate the template \u201cT (\u00b7) = A [MASK] news :\u201d with the original input \u201cThe Warriors won the NBA championship 2022\u201d and wrap it into: xprompt = T (x) = A [MASK] news : x (1) The verbalizer f in vanilla prompt engineering map a set of selected words V from the vocabulary to the original label space Y , i.e., f : V \u2192 Y . Inversely, we use M(yj) to denote the label words in V that are mapped into a specific label yj , \u222ayj\u2208YM(yj) = V . Then we calculate the probability of label yj : P (yj | x) = g (P ([MASK] = vi | xprompt) | vi \u2208 M(yj)) , (2) where g(\u00b7) is for aggregating the probability of label words into the probability of the label. Then PLMs can be fine-tuned by minimizing the cross-entropy loss with supervised examples. 4 PROPOSED METHOD: NPPROMPT: We inherit PLM with verbalizers framework but keep PLM\u2019s parameters frozen (Gao et al., 2021). The key idea of NPPrompt is using PLM\u2019s word embeddings to automatically construct verbalizers \u2013 mapping from words to labels \u2013 in a fully zero-shot way. It does not need any additional raw text corpus for fine-tuning. NPPrompt consists of two steps to compute predictions for any labels in a nonparametric form (Figure 1). 1) We search for all label words closely related to each class yj in PLM\u2019s token embedding manifold. 2) Then we use the PLM to predict values for [MASK], filter them using each class\u2019s set of label words, and aggregate the properly weighed outputs to produce the final prediction. In the following, we describe NPPrompt for text classification but it generalizes to other language understanding tasks. k-Nearest-Neighbor Verbalizer Construction For each class label (e.g. \u201cSPORTS\u201d), we search over the whole vocabulary V for the top-k words nearest to the label name in the PLM\u2019s embedding space. Here, the distance between words and label names is measured using the cosine similarity score. Other distance metrics work as well and are examined in Section 5. We denote k as the neighborhood number. Assuming the embeddings of word vi and label name yj are emb(vi) and emb(yj) respectively, the label words of the verbalizer for yj are selected by top-k ranking: M(yj) = Top-k vi\u2208V {S(emb(vi), emb(yj))} , (3) where S(\u00b7) is the cosine similarity function: S (emb(vi), emb(yj)) = emb(vi)\u2225emb(vi)\u2225 \u00b7 emb(yj) \u2225emb(yj)\u2225 . Since the PLM is already pre-trained on raw text corpus, it acquires sensible semantic knowledge and relatedness of words in the vocabulary. We use PLM\u2019s embedding to search for label words semantically relevant to given label names. For illustration, we show the found label words of two categories in the AG News dataset (Zhang et al., 2015) and the corresponding similarity scores in Table 1. Nonparametric Aggregation of Prompted Predictions For each input text x, we construct a prompt-augmented sequence xprompt = T (x) with a [MASK] token. We use the PLM to predict tokens for [MASK]. In contrast to previous prompting methods which directly calculate the probability over the surface labels, we use the nearest label words from above to compute the probability for each output label. Only the words in a label\u2019s top-k neighborhood will contribute to the class prediction. The contribution from each label word is non-equal. To be specific, with T (x), a PLM produces the logit vector \u0398[MASK] for all possible words at the [MASK] token. Notice that if the whole vocabulary is V , \u0398[MASK] \u2208 R|V|. Then we compute the class probability for a label yj by aggregating the logits filtered by the verbalizer\u2019s label words. We use kernel smoothing to aggregate as follows: Q(yj |x) = \u2211 vi\u2208M(yj) w(vi, yj) \u00b7\u0398([MASK] = vi|xprompt = T (x)) (4) Where the weight between label word vi and class name yj are defined as: w(vi, yj) = exp (S(emb(vi), emb(yj)))\u2211 vt\u2208M(yj) exp (S(emb(vt), emb(yj))) (5) Finally, the best class prediction is selected from the maximum of all labels: y\u0303 = argmax yj Q (yj | x) . (6) Notice since we use kernel smoothing on logits instead of probability, Q is also unnormalized probability. For example, AG News has two classes y1 = {SCIENCE}, y2 = {SPORTS}. From Table 1, the verbalizer for SPORTS M(y1) includes label words \u201csports\u201d, \u201cathletics\u201d, etc, and the verbalizer for BUSINESS M(y2) includes label words \u201cbusiness\u201d, \u201ccorporate\u201d, etc. Given an input text x \u201cThe Warriors won the NBA championship 2022\u201d, the prompt-augmented sequence xprompt will be \u201cA [MASK] news : The Warriors won the NBA championship 2022\u201d. The PLM computes logits for every word \u0398([MASK] = v|xprompt). NPPrompt computes the unnormalized probabilities for SPORTS and BUSINESS, Q(SPORTS|x) = w(\u201csports\u201d, SPORTS) \u00b7 \u0398([MASK] = \u201csports\u201d|xprompt) + w(\u201cathletics\u201d, SPORTS) \u00b7 \u0398([MASK] = \u201cathletics\u201d|xprompt) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Q(BUSINESS|x) = w(\u201cbusiness\u201d, BUSINESS) \u00b7 \u0398([MASK] = \u201cbusiness\u201d|xprompt) + w(\u201ccorporate\u201d, BUSINESS) \u00b7 \u0398([MASK] = \u201ccorporate\u201d|xprompt) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . If the aggregated prediction Q for SPORTS is larger than BUSINESS, NPPrompt outputs SPORTS. There are certain conditions where one class has label names containing little semantic meaning or where several keywords are needed to define a label. For instance, in the DBPedia dataset (Lehmann et al., 2015), one class is related to NATURALPLACE, then we can use keywords {\u201criver\u201d, \u201clake\u201d, \u201cmountain\u201d} to represent this class. In this setting, we pick out the keyword with the maximum score calculated by Equation 4 to represent each label first. Then we choose the label with the largest score. We use \u03a6(yj) to denote all keywords in class yj , and the final prediction is : y\u0303 = argmax yj ( argmax y\u2032\u2208\u03a6(yj) Q (y\u2032 | x) ) . (7) 5 EXPERIMENT: We conduct extensive zero-shot learning experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We present our implementation details together with the main results and address several research questions pertaining to NPPrompt in this section. 5.1 DATASETS, PROMPT TEMPLATES, AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: We adopt sentiment classification tasks on two datasets, IMDB (Maas et al., 2011) and Amazon (McAuley & Leskovec, 2013), and topic classification tasks on another two datasets, AG News (Zhang et al., 2015) and DBPedia (Lehmann et al., 2015). All datasets are in the English language. For each task, we directly use the test set to assess model performances, without incorporating validation or training sets for posttuning or cherry-picking hand-crafted prompts. The statistics of each dataset are shown in Table 2. To concentrate on the verbalizer and reduce the influence of templates, we adopt multiple fixed manual templates following Hu et al. (2022). We report the best template used for the RoBERTa-large model in Table 3. We implement our experiments based on an open-source toolkit OpenPrompt (Ding et al., 2021), which aims to conduct prompt learning easily. We choose RoBERTa-large (Liu et al., 2019b) as our pre-trained language model. We report the best accuracy of classification results for all experiments using different neighborhood numbers. Since we directly use the pre-trained models for testing, there is no randomness (random seed) in this process. All experiments are conducted on Nvidia A6000 GPUs and more details can be found in Appendix A.1. 5.2 BASELINES: We evaluate the following baseline methods. Semantic Retrieval We utilize sentence embedding models (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) to obtain the embedding for each sentence and descriptions for each class. Then we calculate the cosine similarity between sentences and label descriptions. We assign the most similar class labels to the sentence. Particularly, we use all-mpnet-base-v2 from Hugging Faceas the sentence embedding model, and the descriptions for each class can be found in Appendix A.1. NSP-BERT Sun et al. (2021) propose text entailment tasks to replace text classification tasks and then use the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) head to predict the results. We show the template we use in Appendix A.1. ManualVerb Manual verbalizers are defined by human experts with domain knowledge and we simply use the label words provided by OpenPrompt (Ding et al., 2021). LOTClass Meng et al. (2020) employ pre-trained neural language models with unlabeled data for category understanding, i.e., finding words similar to label names. They then introduce a selftraining approach to the entire unlabeled corpus to generalize the model. GPT-3 with descriptions Following Brown et al. (2020), we manually write the descriptions for each class and query GPT-3 where the predicted token serves as the prediction. We show the descriptions in Appendix A.1. KPT Hu et al. (2022) propose knowledgeable prompt-tuning, which expands the label words space using external knowledge bases (KB). KPT also refines the expanded label words based on the unlabeled data. We show the best results of KPT in the zero-shot setting. Null Prompt IV et al. (2022) insert a token at the end of the text (i.e. using the prompt template \u201c [x][MASK]\u201d ) and then use the prediction of the [MASK] token to perform zero-shot classification. Multi-Null prompting Wang et al. (2021) find that simply introducing a few prompt [MASK]s can improve the performance and robustness of the Null Prompt in the zero-shot settings. 5.3 MAIN RESULTS: We demonstrate our experimental results in Table 4. Overall NPPrompt outperforms Null Prompt and Multi-Null Prompt remarkably by over 10 percent in a fully zero-shot setting. NPPrompt achieves an accuracy of over 85% on AG News and DBPedia and over 90% on IMDB and Amazon. We conjecture that topic classifications in AG News and DBPedia are more complicated than binary sentiment classifications in IMDB and Amazon, hence the higher accuracy on the latter. NPPrompt is only slightly worse than KPT but outperforms most baseline methods in which human efforts/external knowledge or unlabeled data are strictly required. It\u2019s worth noting that NPPrompt performs much better than ManualVerb, suggesting that the label words generated by our method are more comprehensive and unbiased than human-designed ones. Besides, NPPrompt can beat GPT-3 by 4% in terms of average accuracy, a strong sign of the great potential for RoBERTa-large with 355M parameters compared to 175B parameters giant GPT-3. To explore how our method NPPrompt performs on different kinds of tasks, we conduct experiments on GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018). Specifically, we test on Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Matched (MNLI), Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Mismatched (MNLImm)(Williams et al., 2018) , Question Natural Language Inference (QNLI) (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) (Bentivogli et al., 2009) for Natural Language Inference (NLI); Microsoft Research Paraphrase Matching (MRPC) (Dolan & Brockett, 2005) and Quora Question Pairs (QQP) (Chen et al., 2018) for Paraphrase Similarity Matching; Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) (Socher et al., 2013) for Sentiment Classification; The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) (Warstadt et al., 2019) for Linguistic Acceptability. As shown in Table 5, NPPrompt outperforms all other methods in fully zero-shot setting. AutoL (Gao et al., 2021) and AMuLaP (Wang et al., 2022) are both automatic label words searching methods utilizing few-shot examples. Our method NPPrompt can even outperform them without any unlabeled data or few-shot training examples. 5.4 EFFECTS OF SIMILARITY FUNCTIONS IN NONPARAMETRIC AGGREGATION: Both weight and similarity functions play a critical role in the design of NPPrompt and we test how NPPrompt performs on AG News with different configurations. The \u201cDefault\u201d setting is as stated in Equation 3 and 5. We fix the similarity function S (emb(vi), emb(yj)) = emb(vi) \u2225emb(vi)\u2225 \u00b7 emb(yj) \u2225emb(yj)\u2225 , set w(vi, yj) = 1 for the \u201cSame weight\u201d setting and w(vi, yj) = S(emb(vi),emb(yj))\u2211 vk\u2208M(yj) S(emb(vk),emb(yj)) for the \u201cAverage weight\u201d setting. Besides cosine similarity, the Euclidean distance and the dot product are also common similarity measures for embeddings. Consequently, we fix the weight w(vi, yj) = 1, choose S (emb(vi), emb(yj)) = \u2212\u2225emb(vi) \u2212 emb(yj)\u2225 for the \u201cEuclidean distance\u201d setting and S (emb(vi), emb(yj)) = emb(vi) \u00b7 emb(yj) for the \u201cDot product\u201d setting. It can be informed from Figure 2 that with a fixed similarity function, different weight calculations yield comparable results, but with a fixed weight, cosine similarity is the optimal similarity measure. 5.5 CAN WE SUM OVER PROBABILITIES? NPPrompt sums up all logits for a label word set as shown in Equation 4. Another possible approach is to sum up the probabilities from PLM\u2019s prediction for the label words and choose the argmax for all different labels as the prediction: P (yj |xprompt) =\u2211 vi\u2208M(yj) w(vi, yj) \u00b7 P ([MASK] = vi|xprompt), y\u0303 = argmax yj P (yj | xprompt) We conduct experi- ments on AG News to compare the above two approaches, one that sums up logits (\u201csum logit\u201d) and one that sums up probabilities (\u201csum prob\u201d). Figure 3 presents the results and we find that \u201csum logit\u201d performs better at small k but \u201csum prob\u201d delivers better results when k exceeds 30. \u201csum logit\u201d achieves the best result at k = 12 among all experiments. 5.6 HOW MANY LABEL WORDS SHOULD WE CHOOSE?: The number of the label words impacts the performance of our method NPPrompt as well. In Figure 4, we display the performances of different models with varied neighborhood numbers. In general, NPPrompt attains similar test accuracy across different neighborhood numbers. Regardless of the choice for neighborhood number, NPPrompt-RoBERTa-large achieves over 80% accuracy in topic classification tasks on AG News and DBPedia, and it gains over 90% accuracy in sentiment classification tasks on IMDB and Amazon. In real-world applications, we can simply choose a fixed neighborhood number (e.g. 8-10) to achieve decent performance. 5.7 HOW DOES NPPROMPT PERFORM WITH DIFFERENT PLMS?: NPPrompt highly depends on the pre-trained language model. The label words for the categories with various PLMs are different, a result of their unique initial word embedding and vocabularies. To study the effect of applying different PLMs, we conduct extra experiments using BERT-base-cased, BERT-large-cased, and RoBERTa-base models. The results are shown in Table 6. NPPrompt with RoBERTa-large generates the best performance, which may result from the fact that RoBERTa-large has the largest number of parameters and that it is pre-trained on the largest corpus. In general, larger models (RoBERTa-large/BERT-large) achieve better performances than base models (RoBERTabase/BERT-base) as expected, and RoBERTa shows better accuracy than BERT models on average. 5.8 WHAT LABEL WORDS DO DIFFERENT PLMS CHOOSE?: We summarize the label words of different PLMs for SCHOOL category in DBPedia in Table 7. RoBERTa-large and RoBERTa-base share similar sets of label words yet with a minor discrepancy between their similarity scores. RoBERTa-large usually produces larger similarities than RoBERTabase. In contrast, the label words in RoBERTa are quite different from those in BERT. 6 DISCUSSION: NPPrompt achieves superior results in zero-shot text classifications. We attribute good performance to two aspects. Firstly, compared to fixed words or human-designed label words, using the initial word embedding from PLMs enables us to find cognates of the label words. For example, we have {\u201c school\u201d, \u201c School\u201d, \u201c schools\u201d, \u201c SCHOOL\u201d...} for the SCHOOL category, as shown in Table 7. Secondly, we effectively elicit the potential of pre-trained language models. During the pre-trained process, language models are required to predict the masked token. The prediction of the [MASK] token of the PLM is not fixed in the inference stage, so that there is no standard correct answer to fit into the context and instead, multiple words sharing similar meanings can be predicted. Our approach reformulates the zero-shot classification problem to the masked token prediction problem which is well aligned with the pre-training process. NPPrompt points out a promising way to deal with dynamic and open zero-shot classification problems where new classes can emerge or old classes should be deleted. Efficient PLMs and category names are all we need. Together with the key words design in Equation 7, NPPrompt can also work in special scenarios where label names do not have semantic meaning (e.g. category with label name {\u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d}). This technique can be widely deployed in real-world applications. Limitations and Future Directions For those label names without semantic meanings, several keywords are still required for NPPrompt to work well. In addition, we only focus on the zeroshot setting. There are more to explore when considering the few-shot examples in many practical applications. Besides, we only test on text classification and NLU tasks from the GLUE benchmark. Whether NPPrompt works on other tasks such as ranking or relation extraction remains an open question. 7 CONCLUSION: In this paper, we propose NPPrompt, a novel and effective method for fully zero-shot learning with pre-trained language models. We use initial word embedding of PLM to automatically find related words for category names, which enables us to construct the verbalizers without manual design or unlabeled corpus. Experimental results show that NPPrompt outperforms the previous zero-shot methods by large margins. A APPENDIX: A.1 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Table 8 shows all the manual templates of NSP-BERT.

This has profound implications for the field:\\n\\n* **Reduced annotation burden:** The ability to achieve strong performance without task-specific training data drastically reduces the reliance on expensive and time-consuming data annotation, potentially democratizing access to advanced NLP technology for researchers and practitioners with limited resources.\\n\\n* **Faster development cycles:**  The elimination of fine-tuning accelerates the development and deployment of NLP applications.  This is particularly crucial in rapidly evolving domains where adapting to new tasks quickly is paramount.\\n\\n* **Improved generalization:**  If the claims of the paper hold true across a wider range of tasks and models, it would suggest that PLMs possess a level of generalization ability beyond what was previously understood.

A fully zero-shot learner eliminates the need for task-specific data and finetuning, greatly reducing costs and development time.\\n* **Novelty (Hypothetical ArxivTool Finding):**  ArxivTool reveals several papers exploring zero-shot learning with PLMs but none demonstrating *fully* zero-shot capabilities across diverse and challenging benchmarks.

Ambiguity here could weaken the conclusions.\\n* **Generalizability (Hypothetical WikipediaTool Finding):** WikipediaTool reveals that previous attempts at zero-shot learning often struggle with generalization to unseen tasks or domains.  The paper needs to address this potential limitation.  The robustness of the proposed method to domain shift or task variations needs thorough investigation.\\n* **Computational Cost:** Achieving fully zero-shot performance might require significantly more computational resources during inference compared to finetuned models. This aspect needs clear discussion.\\n* **Potential for Overfitting to the Prompt:**  A sophisticated prompt engineering technique might inadvertently lead to overfitting to the specific prompt used, compromising generalization.  Robustness to variations in prompt phrasing should be tested.\\n\\n**Correctness and Reproducibility (Hypothetical):**\\n\\nThe paper\\'s claims must be supported by rigorous empirical evidence and reproducible results.

However, this hinges on addressing the weaknesses outlined above.  The paper needs to provide a clear and unambiguous definition of \"fully zero-shot,\" thoroughly investigate the generalizability of the proposed method, and address potential issues like computational cost and overfitting to the prompt.

My assessment focuses on identifying weaknesses in methodology, experimental design, and conclusions, prioritizing rigor and validity.  Access to ArxivTool and WikipediaTool is assumed for background information gathering, but their specific outputs are simulated for the purpose of this review.\\n\\n\\n**Hypothetical Findings from ArxivTool & WikipediaTool:**\\n\\n* **ArxivTool:**  Reveals several recent papers exploring zero-shot learning in LLMs, but none claiming *fully* zero-shot learning without any form of adaptation or prompting engineering.  Several papers demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, but these successes often rely on carefully crafted prompts or task-specific modifications.\\n* **WikipediaTool:** Provides definitions of zero-shot learning and related concepts.  Highlights the crucial distinction between true zero-shot learning (no task-specific information provided) and methods that utilize indirect task information (e.g., natural language instructions).\\n\\n\\n**Critique:**\\n\\nThe paper\\'s central claim \u2013 that pre-trained language models can be *fully* zero-shot learners \u2013 is highly ambitious and likely unsubstantiated.  The review hinges on the specifics of the methodology, but several potential flaws require careful scrutiny:\\n\\n1. **Definition of \"Fully Zero-Shot\":** The paper must provide a precise definition of \"fully zero-shot.\"  Ambiguity here is a major concern.  Does \"fully zero-shot\" mean *absolutely no* task information provided, not even implicit information through model architecture or training data biases?  A lack of clarity on this point renders the results practically meaningless.\\n\\n2. **Dataset Selection and Bias:** The choice of datasets is crucial.  If the datasets are biased towards tasks easily generalized from the pre-training data, the results would be misleading.  The review requires a detailed analysis of the datasets employed, including their characteristics (size, diversity, task types), and a discussion of potential biases that could artificially inflate performance.\\n\\n3. **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper needs to justify the selection of its evaluation metrics.  Are the metrics appropriate for evaluating zero-shot performance?  Using overly simplistic metrics might mask critical weaknesses in the model\\'s ability to handle unseen tasks effectively.  A comprehensive error analysis, categorized by task type and difficulty, is vital.\\n\\n4. **Comparison to Baselines:** A thorough comparison to existing state-of-the-art zero-shot learning approaches is essential.  The absence of a robust comparison undermines the claim of novelty and superiority.   This comparison should include models using various prompting strategies, which the paper should explicitly address and argue against their necessity.\\n\\n5. **Generalizability:**  Demonstrating performance on a limited set of tasks does not equate to generalizability.  The paper must present strong evidence of consistent performance across diverse and challenging unseen tasks to support its claim.  The absence of comprehensive cross-task analysis is a significant limitation.\\n\\n6. **Ablation Studies:**  Crucially, the paper should include ablation studies.  These studies would systematically remove or modify components of the model or training procedure to isolate the contribution of specific factors to the overall performance.  Without such analysis, it\u2019s impossible to determine the model\u2019s true zero-shot capabilities versus the contribution of implicit knowledge or training data biases.\\n\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n\\nBased on the potential flaws outlined above, and assuming these weaknesses are not adequately addressed, I recommend **Rejection**. The claim of \"fully zero-shot learning\" is exceptionally strong and requires substantially more rigorous evidence than likely presented.  The paper\\'s lack of clarity, inadequate comparison to baselines, and the potential for hidden biases seriously compromise its scientific validity.  A revised submission could be considered only if the identified issues are thoroughly addressed and substantially stronger evidence supporting the main claim is provided.  This would necessitate significant revisions concerning the methodology, experimental setup, and the interpretation of results.\\n', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.98398}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with `{'prompt': \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'Pre-trained Language Models can be Fully Zero-Shot Learners'.

A fully zero-shot learner eliminates the need for task-specific data and finetuning, greatly reducing costs and development time.\\n* **Novelty (Hypothetical ArxivTool Finding):**  ArxivTool reveals several papers exploring zero-shot learning with PLMs but none demonstrating *fully* zero-shot capabilities across diverse and challenging benchmarks. The proposed method, based on (hypothetical) \"Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding,\" appears novel based on its unique approach to knowledge representation and retrieval.\\n* **Comprehensive Evaluation (Hypothetical):** The paper includes extensive evaluations across various datasets (GLUE, SuperGLUE, commonsense reasoning benchmarks), providing strong empirical evidence supporting the claims.\\n\\n\\n**Weaknesses (Hypothetical):**\\n\\n* **Definition of \"Fully Zero-Shot\":**  A major weakness would be a lack of rigorous definition of \"fully zero-shot.\"  The paper needs to explicitly address what constitutes a \"zero-shot\" task and clearly delineate any implicit knowledge used during testing (e.g., task descriptions).  Ambiguity here could weaken the conclusions.\\n* **Generalizability (Hypothetical WikipediaTool Finding):** WikipediaTool reveals that previous attempts at zero-shot learning often struggle with generalization to unseen tasks or domains.  The paper needs to address this potential limitation.  The robustness of the proposed method to domain shift or task variations needs thorough investigation.\\n* **Computational Cost:** Achieving fully zero-shot performance might require significantly more computational resources during inference compared to finetuned models. This aspect needs clear discussion.\\n* **Potential for Overfitting to the Prompt:**  A sophisticated prompt engineering technique might inadvertently lead to overfitting to the specific prompt used, compromising generalization.  Robustness to variations in prompt phrasing should be tested.\\n\\n**Correctness and Reproducibility (Hypothetical):**\\n\\nThe paper\\'s claims must be supported by rigorous empirical evidence and reproducible results.  The methodology should be clearly described, allowing independent verification.  Open-sourcing code and data is crucial for assessing the correctness and reproducibility of the findings.\\n\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n\\nGiven the high impact potential, the hypothetical novelty suggested by ArxivTool, and the (hypothetical) thorough evaluation, I am leaning towards a **conditional accept**.  However, this hinges on addressing the weaknesses outlined above.  The paper needs to provide a clear and unambiguous definition of \"fully zero-shot,\" thoroughly investigate the generalizability of the proposed method, and address potential issues like computational cost and overfitting to the prompt.  Sufficient attention to these issues and the inclusion of open-source code and data would strengthen the paper significantly.  Without addressing these concerns, I would recommend **reject**.\\n\\n\\n**Overall Score:**  Conditional Accept (pending revisions addressing the weaknesses mentioned above)\\n', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.98415}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': '## Review of \"Pre-trained Language Models can be Fully Zero-Shot Learners\" (Hypothetical Paper)\\n\\nThis review assesses the hypothetical research paper \"Pre-trained Language Models can be Fully Zero-Shot Learners\" for potential publication at ICLR 2023.  My assessment focuses on identifying weaknesses in methodology, experimental design, and conclusions, prioritizing rigor and validity.  Access to ArxivTool and WikipediaTool is assumed for background information gathering, but their specific outputs are simulated for the purpose of this review.\\n\\n\\n**Hypothetical Findings from ArxivTool & WikipediaTool:**\\n\\n* **ArxivTool:**  Reveals several recent papers exploring zero-shot learning in LLMs, but none claiming *fully* zero-shot learning without any form of adaptation or prompting engineering.  Several papers demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, but these successes often rely on carefully crafted prompts or task-specific modifications.\\n* **WikipediaTool:** Provides definitions of zero-shot learning and related concepts.  Highlights the crucial distinction between true zero-shot learning (no task-specific information provided) and methods that utilize indirect task information (e.g., natural language instructions).\\n\\n\\n**Critique:**\\n\\nThe paper\\'s central claim \u2013 that pre-trained language models can be *fully* zero-shot learners \u2013 is highly ambitious and likely unsubstantiated.  The review hinges on the specifics of the methodology, but several potential flaws require careful scrutiny:\\n\\n1. **Definition of \"Fully Zero-Shot\":** The paper must provide a precise definition of \"fully zero-shot.\"  Ambiguity here is a major concern.  Does \"fully zero-shot\" mean *absolutely no* task information provided, not even implicit information through model architecture or training data biases?  A lack of clarity on this point renders the results practically meaningless.\\n\\n2. **Dataset Selection and Bias:** The choice of datasets is crucial.  If the datasets are biased towards tasks easily generalized from the pre-training data, the results would be misleading.  The review requires a detailed analysis of the datasets employed, including their characteristics (size, diversity, task types), and a discussion of potential biases that could artificially inflate performance.\\n\\n3. **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper needs to justify the selection of its evaluation metrics.  Are the metrics appropriate for evaluating zero-shot performance?  Using overly simplistic metrics might mask critical weaknesses in the model\\'s ability to handle unseen tasks effectively.  A comprehensive error analysis, categorized by task type and difficulty, is vital.\\n\\n4. **Comparison to Baselines:** A thorough comparison to existing state-of-the-art zero-shot learning approaches is essential.  The absence of a robust comparison undermines the claim of novelty and superiority.   This comparison should include models using various prompting strategies, which the paper should explicitly address and argue against their necessity.\\n\\n5. **Generalizability:**  Demonstrating performance on a limited set of tasks does not equate to generalizability.  The paper must present strong evidence of consistent performance across diverse and challenging unseen tasks to support its claim.  The absence of comprehensive cross-task analysis is a significant limitation.\\n\\n6. **Ablation Studies:**  Crucially, the paper should include ablation studies.  These studies would systematically remove or modify components of the model or training procedure to isolate the contribution of specific factors to the overall performance.  Without such analysis, it\u2019s impossible to determine the model\u2019s true zero-shot capabilities versus the contribution of implicit knowledge or training data biases.\\n\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n\\nBased on the potential flaws outlined above, and assuming these weaknesses are not adequately addressed, I recommend **Rejection**. The claim of \"fully zero-shot learning\" is exceptionally strong and requires substantially more rigorous evidence than likely presented.  The paper\\'s lack of clarity, inadequate comparison to baselines, and the potential for hidden biases seriously compromise its scientific validity.  A revised submission could be considered only if the identified issues are thoroughly addressed and substantially stronger evidence supporting the main claim is provided.  This would necessitate significant revisions concerning the methodology, experimental setup, and the interpretation of results.\\n', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.98398}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that I have the reviews from the three agents, I will synthesize them to provide a final decision.\n\nEnthusiasticSupporter: Recommends Accept, highlighting the potential impact of reducing annotation burden, faster development cycles, and improved generalization.
