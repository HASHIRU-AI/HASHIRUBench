The paper title is: Modeling content creator incentives on algorithm-curated platforms\n\nNone: 1 INTRODUCTION n producers In 2018, Jonah Peretti (CEO, Buzzfeed) raised alarm when a Facebook main feed update started boosting junk and divisive content (Hagey & Horwitz, 2021). In Poland, the same update caused an uptick in negative political messaging (Hagey & Horwitz, 2021). Tailoring content to algorithms is not unique to social media. For example, some search engine optimization (SEO) professionals specialize on managing impacts of Google Search updates (Marentis, 2014; Dennis, 2016; Shahzad et al., 2020; Patil et al., 2021; Goodwin, 2021). While motivations for adapting content range from economic to socio-political, they often translate into the same operative goal: exposure maximization. We study how algorithms affect exposure- maximizing content creators. We propose a novel incentive-based behavior model called an exposure game, where producers compete for a finite user attention pool by crafting content ranked highly by a given algorithm (Section 1.1). When producers act strategically, a steady state\u2014Nash equilibrium (NE)\u2014may be reached, with no one able to unilaterally improve their exposure (utility). The content produced in a NE can thus be interpreted as what the algorithm implicitly incentivizes. We focus on algorithms which model user preferences as an inner product of d-dimensional user and item embeddings, and rank items by the estimated preference. Section 2 presents theoretical results on the NE induced by these algorithms. We identify cases where algorithmic changes seemingly unconnected to producer incentives\u2014e.g., switching from non-negative to unconstrained embeddings\u2014determine whether there are zero, one, or multiple NE. The character of NE is also affected by the level of algorithmic exploration. Perhaps counter-intuitively, we show that high levels of exploration incentivize broadly appealing content, whereas low levels lead to specialization. In Section 3, we explore how creator behavior models can facilitate a pre-deployment audit. Such an audit could be particularly useful for assessing the producer impact of algorithmic changes, which is hard to measure by A/B testing for two important reasons: (1) producers cannot be easily randomized to distinct treatment groups, and (2) there is often a delay between deployment and content adaptation. Our hope is that this new style of auditing will enable detection of misalignment between the induced and desired incentives, and thus flag issues to either immediately address, or monitor in content filtering and moderation. For demonstration, we execute a pre-deployment audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets using the exposure game behavior model. We find the incentivized content exhibits a strong dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity (confirming our theory), and between model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups. 1.1 SETTING AND THE EXPOSURE GAME INCENTIVE MODEL: We assume there is a fixed recommender system trained on past data, and a fixed population of users (consumers). Together, these induce a demand distribution Pc which represents typical traffic on the platform over a predefined period of time. Content is created by n \u2208 N producers who try to maximize their expected exposure (utility). Denoting consumers by c \u223c Pc, an item created by the ith producer by si (strategy), s := (si)i\u2208[n], and s\\i := (sj)j \u0338=i, we define (expected) exposure as the proportion of the \u201cuser attention pool\u201d captured by the ith producer ui(s) = ui(si, s\\i) := Ec\u223cPc [1{c is exposed to si}] \u22c6 = Ec\u223cPc [pi(c)] , (1) with pi(c) \u2265 0 the probability that the algorithm exposes c to si rather than any s\\i. As common in game theory, we can extend from deterministic single item strategies to stochastic multi-item strategies si \u223c Pi for some distribution Pi. This extension is discussed in more detail in Section 2. The assumption that E[1{c is exposed to si}] \u22c6= E[pi(c)] ignores cases where some interactions are not mediated by the algorithm (e.g., YouTube videos linked to by an external website). This may be a reasonable approximation for infinite feed platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, TikTok) where most consumers scroll through items in the algorithm-defined order, and search engines (e.g., Google, Bing) where first-page bias is well documented (Craswell et al., 2008). While similar assumptions are common in the literature (e.g., Li et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2019; Ben-Porat et al., 2020; Curmei et al., 2021), alternative interaction models are an important future research direction. Unlike previous work (Section 1.2), we focus on the popular class of factorization-based algorithms. These models rank items by a score estimated by the inner product of user and item embeddings c, si \u2208 Rd. The larger this score, the higher the probability of exposure, which we model as pi(c) = exp(\u03c4\u22121\u27e8c, si\u27e9)\u2211n i\u2032=1 exp(\u03c4 \u22121\u27e8c, si\u2032\u27e9) = softmax ([ \u03c4\u22121\u27e8c, si\u2032\u27e9 ]n i\u2032=1 ) i , (2) where \u03c4 \u2265 0 is a temperature parameter which controls the spread of exposure probabilities over the top scoring items. When \u03c4 = 0 (i.e., hardmax), these probabilities correspond to top-1 recommendation or absolute first-position bias. Taking \u03c4 > 0 models the effects of ranked position, injected randomness for exploration, and even interactions not mediated by the algorithm. While an approximation in some settings, Equation (2) has been directly used, e.g., by YouTube (Chen et al., 2019). We emphasize we make no assumption on how the embeddings are obtained. Our conclusions thus apply equally to classical matrix factorization and deep learning-based systems. We are now ready to formalize exposure games, an incentive-based model of creator behavior. Definition 1. An exposure game consists of an embedding dimension d \u2208 N, a demand distribution Pc \u2208 P(Rd), and n \u2208 N producers (players), each with an associated (pure) strategy space si \u2208 Sd\u22121 and utility function ui(s) = Ec\u223cPc [pi(c)] with pi(c) as in Equation (2) for a given \u03c4 \u2265 0. We restrict items si to the unit sphere Sd\u22121 = {v \u2208 Rd : \u2225v\u2225 = 1}. A norm constraint is necessary as otherwise exposure could be maximized by inflating \u2225si\u2225 \u2192 \u221e, which is not observed in practice.1 We distinguish non-negative games where all embeddings lie in the positive orthant; this includes algorithms ranging from TF-IDF, bag-of-words, non-negative matrix factorization (Lee & Seung, 1Possibly due to the often finite rating scale, use of gradient clipping, and various forms of regularization. 1999), topic models (Blei et al., 2003), and constrained neural networks (Ayinde & Zurada, 2017). Definition 2. A non-negative exposure game is an exposure game where the support of Pc is restricted to the positive orthant, i.e., Pc({c \u2208 Rd : cj \u2265 0 ,\u2200j \u2208 [d]}) = 1. We assume all producers are rational, omniscient, and fully control placement of si in Sd\u22121. These assumptions are standard in both machine learning and economics literature, including in the related facility location games (see Section 1.2). They often provide a good first order approximation, and an important basis for studying the subtleties of real-world behavior in all its complexity. Full control is perhaps the least realistic, since producers can only modify their features ingested by the algorithm in practice. This assumption has a significant advantage though: it abstracts away an explicit model of producer actions (cf. the variety of SEO techniques). Appropriateness of rationality and complete information are then context-dependent; they may be respectively reasonable in environments where strong profit motives or user profiling tools are common. However, investigating alternatives to each of the above assumptions is an important direction of future work. creator income streams direct user payment (Super Chat & Super Stickers) external (o -platform) webshops memberships YouTube Premium ad share merch sponsored content donation services (e.g., PayPal and Patreon) a liate marketing (sponsored links) (YouTube Partner Programme) Figure 2: Youtube revenue streams incentivizing exposure maximization (\u00d8rmen & Gregersen, 2022). Box 1: How our assumptions map onto YouTube (YT) as an illustrative example. On YT, a strategy si is an embedding of a video, with creators able to produce multiple videos (mixed strategy si \u223c Pi). Rational behavior: YT creators receive income proportional to their view numbers (Figure 2), which motivates exposure maximization. Most creators do not earn significant income, but the majority of traffic is driven by only a few popular and high-earning creators (Cheng et al., 2008). This motivates focus on these few producers and their strategic behavior. Complete information and full-control. YT creators cannot directly manipulate the embeddings of their videos si, or observe the user embeddings. However, popular creators have a myriad of analytic tools at their hand, with information about views, demographics (e.g., gender, age, region), acquisition channels, drivers of engagement, competition and more. They can also observe and adopt behaviors of other creators. Taking the strong monetary incentives into account, motivated creators will actively optimize their exposure using trial-and-error, making complete information and full-control an imperfect yet not unreasonable model of their behavior. 1.2 RELATED WORK: Most relevant to our setup are works on the incentives of exposure-maximizing creators induced by recommender and retrieval systems (Ben-Porat et al., 2020; Raifer et al., 2017; Ben-Basat et al., 2017; Ben-Porat & Tennenholtz, 2018; Ben-Porat et al., 2019b;a). Interesting aspects of these works which we omit include (i) repeated interactions (Ben-Porat et al., 2020; Raifer et al., 2017; Ben-Porat et al., 2019b), (ii) user welfare (Ben-Porat et al., 2020; Ben-Basat et al., 2017; Ben-Porat & Tennenholtz, 2018; Ben-Porat et al., 2019a), and (iii) incomplete information (Raifer et al., 2017). The most important distinction of our approach is that the above works constrain creators to a predefined finite item catalog. This excludes the popular factorization-based algorithms\u2014ranging from standard matrix factorization (Koren et al., 2009) to (deep) two-tower architectures (Huang et al., 2013; Yi et al., 2019)\u2014whose continuous embedding space translates into an infinite number of possible items. The only exception is (Ben-Porat et al., 2019a) where items are represented by [0, 1] scalars, which is equivalent to the special case of two-dimensional non-negative exposure games. Continuous embedding spaces were recently studied in (Mladenov et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2021), but neither studies producer incentives or competition. Mladenov et al. (2020) consider producers who decide whether to stay or leave the platform if their exposure is too low. Zhan et al. (2021) study design of recommender systems which optimize for both user and producer utility. Concurrently but independently, Jagadeesan et al. (2022) study a model equivalent to hardmax nonnegative exposure games, except the \u2225si\u2225 = 1 constraint is replaced by a production cost, yielding ui(s) = E[pi(c)]\u2212 \u2225si\u2225\u03b2 for some norm \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 and \u03b2 \u2265 1 (higher norm interpreted as higher quality). The authors investigate how the cost function influences the economic phenomena exhibited by NE, from formation of \u201cgenres\u201d (multiple directions with non-zero probability), to the possibility of realizing positive profits (utility). In contrast, we investigate how NE depend on algorithmic and environmental factors (non-negativity, exploration, dependence of exposure on ranking), and propose an algorithmic audit which leverages the creator model. While taking \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e in the Jagadeesan et al.\u2019s cost recovers our unit norm constraint, understanding the NE behavior at the limit remains a subject of future work (e.g., pure NE exist only in our setup). Our works are thus largely complementary. Literature on adaptive behavior in the presence of a prediction algorithm is also relevant (Hardt et al., 2016; Kleinberg & Raghavan, 2020; Perdomo et al., 2020; Jagadeesan et al., 2021). The social impact and potential disparate effects of strategic adaptation have been analyzed in (Milli et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). Most relevant for us is a recent paper by Liu et al. (2022) which studies strategic adaptation in the context of finite resources (e.g., number of accepted college applicants). Unlike us, the authors assume a single score for each competitor, who can pay cost to improve it. A principal then designs a reward function which allocates the finite resource based on the scores, and the authors study how different choices affect various notions of welfare. The preliminary results on multidimensional scores (appendix B) assume the scores and individual improvements are independent, whereas our scores\u2014\u27e8c, si\u27e9 for each c\u2014imply complex dependence and trade-offs. Finally, our proposed methods for auditing recommender and information retrieval systems belong to a rapidly growing algorithm auditing toolbox. We focus on understanding producer incentives caused by a known algorithm. Thus, we complement prior work that aims to audit these systems based upon: the degree of consumer control (Curmei et al., 2021), fairness (Do et al., 2021), compliance with regulations (Cen & Shah, 2021), and dynamical behavior in simulations (Krauth et al., 2020; Lucherini et al., 2021) or deployed systems Haroon et al. (2022). 2 EQUILIBRIA IN EXPOSURE GAMES: This section presents theoretical results on incentives in exposure games. We focus on the impact of the recommender/information retrieval model on the competitive equilibria. Throughout, we find that one of the most important factors determining existence and character of equilibria is the temperature \u03c4 (see Equation (2)). We thus distinguish the softmax (\u03c4 > 0) and the hardmax (\u03c4 = 0) case. In competitive settings, a key question is whether there are equilibria in which players are satisfied with their strategies, as otherwise there may be never-ending oscillation in search for better outcomes. We thus consider several solution concepts (i.e., definitions of equilibria) related to NE. A pure NE (PNE) is a point in strategy space sNE \u2208 (Sd\u22121)n where no player i can increase their utility by unilaterally deviating from sNEi \u2208 Sd\u22121. In other words, no content producer can increase their exposure by modifying their content. Mixed NE (MNE) refer to the setting where players are allowed to choose randomized (mixed) strategies Pi \u2208 P(Sd\u22121). Rather than selecting a single piece of content, a creator following a mixed strategy samples si \u223c Pi. Alternative interpretation is that producers create multiple items, splitting their time/budget proportionally to the Pi-probabilities. In later sections, we explore the weaker solution concepts of \u03f5-NE, local NE (LNE), and their combination \u03f5-LNE. An \u03f5-NE is an approximate NE where no producer can unilaterally increase their utility by more than \u03f5 (NE are \u201c0-NE\u201d). LNE are analogous to local optima: points where no player benefits from small deviations from their strategy. The approximate and local perspectives are relevant when deploying local search algorithms to find NE numerically (Section 3). Exposure games are symmetric, meaning that any permutation of strategies forming an equilibrium produces another equilibrium. Our statements on the existence and uniqueness of equilibria hold up to player permutation. All proofs for the results in this section are presented in the appendix. 2.1 PURE AND MIXED NASH EQUILIBRIA: We begin by characterizing the existence of pure and mixed NE in general exposure games. Theorem 1. Every exposure game has at least one mixed Nash equilibrium. A key property of softmax games is that the utilities ui are continuous in s. This, and the compactness of the strategy space Sd\u22121, guarantees existence of MNE via a classic result by Glicksberg (1952). In the hardmax case (\u03c4 = 0), we can show that MNE are guaranteed to exist through a direct application of proposition 4 due to Simon (1987). The producer utilities ui are not differentiable in the hardmax case though, which means we cannot use gradient information to find NE as in the softmax case. The only procedure we know for finding NE in hardmax games requires solving the hitting set problem which is NP-complete (Dasgupta et al., 2008). See Appendix B for further discussion. We now turn to existence of pure NE, which is the setting where creators strategically design a single piece of content. Unlike MNE, PNE are not guaranteed to exist even in the softmax case. Theorem 2. PNE need not exist in either the hardmax (\u03c4 = 0) or softmax (\u03c4 > 0) exposure games. Figure 3A illustrates the non-existence result. The counter-example holds even for n = 2 players and planar (d = 2) strategies. A reader familiar with classic PNE results may ask if PNE would appear if we relaxed the Sd\u22121 strategy space to the convex Bd = {v : \u2225v\u2225 \u2264 1} (Glicksberg, 1952; Debreu, 1952; Fan, 1952). This is not true as the exposure utility is not quasi-concave (Figure 3B&C). We now move to non-negative exposure games (Definition 2). For n = d = 2, non-negative hardmax exposure games are equivalent to Hotelling games (Hotelling, 1929), and more generally to facility location games on a line (Ben-Porat et al., 2019a; Procaccia & Tennenholtz, 2013). The next proposition lists several special cases in which we understand existence and character of PNE. Proposition 1. A PNE always exists in n = d = 2 non-negative hardmax games, but may not without non-negativity or when d > 2. For n = 2 non-negative softmax games with c\u0302 := 1n (1\u2212 1n )E[c] \u0338= 0, the only possible PNE is s1 = s2 = c\u0304 with c\u0304 := c\u0302/\u2225c\u0302\u2225 (independently of d), but a PNE may not exist. When n > 2, non-negative softmax games can have a PNE other than s1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = sn = c\u0304. Figure 3D illustrates a 4-player non-negative exposure game. Depending on the temperature, we observe either the collapsed si = c\u0304 (large \u03c4 ), or what we term \u201cprotective positioning\u201d (small \u03c4 ). In Figure 3D, players place their strategies between a consumer and the next closest producer. Figure 3E illustrates protective positioning for a higher number of consumers and n = 3. Here, consumers are roughly clustered around three centers (blue dots). The producer strategies are close to these centers, but again offset towards the most contested consumers. 2.2 \u03f5-NASH EQUILIBRIA While existence of NE is not guaranteed, the situation changes when we adopt the weaker solution concept of \u03f5-NE, in which no producer can unilaterally increase their utility by more than \u03f5. The existence and character of such equilibria strongly depends on the temperature \u03c4 . When \u03c4 = \u221e, exposure is equally likely pi(c) = 1n for all i and c regardless of the adopted strategies. Thus, every strategy profile is an NE. Considering a sequence of increasing (\u03c4i)i\u22651, we can therefore argue that the limit of any convergent sequence of NE indexed by \u03c4 is a NE at \u03c4 = \u221e. Interestingly, Theorem 3 shows that a sufficiently large but finite \u03c4 > 0 is sufficient for existence of \u03f5-(P)NE. The result is constructive, showing that the \u03f5-PNE is parallel to the average consumer embedding. Theorem 3. For any \u03f5 > 0 and Pc \u2208 P(Rd) with compact support and E[c] \u0338= 0, \u2203\u03c40 > 0 s.t. s1 = . . . = sn = c\u0304 is an \u03f5-PNE for all \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c40. Moreover, for all \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c40, the smallest \u03f5\u03c4 for which c\u0304 is an \u03f5\u03c4 -PNE satisfies \u03f5\u03c4 \u2264 \u03f5\u03c4 . If also \u03f5 < \u2225c\u0302\u2225, then the set of better-responses to c\u0304 \u03a8(c\u0304) := {v \u2208 Sd\u22121 :u1(v, c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304) \u2265 u1(c\u0304, c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304)} , (3) is a subset of Bd\u03b4 (c\u0304) = {v : \u2225v \u2212 c\u0304\u2225 \u2264 \u03b4} with \u03b4 = 2\u03f5/(\u2225c\u0302\u2225 \u2212 \u03f5), and \u03b4 \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. This result shows that all \u03f5-improvements concentrate near the consumer average \u03f5-PNE as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Additionally, the \u201cconsumer symmetry\u201d \u2225c\u0302\u2225 = 1n (1 \u2212 1n ) \u2225E[c]\u2225 determines how quickly \u03b4 \u2192 0. When consumers are spread approximately symmetrically w.r.t. the origin, the degenerate equilibrium appears only for large \u03c4 . However, smaller \u03c4 are sufficient for more directionally concentrated Pc. A high number of producers also slows the concentration as the appeal of ui(c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304) = 1n decreases with n. We conclude with a corollary based on our development so far. Corollary 1. There is a fixed \u03f50 > 0 and a demand distribution Pc which\u2014depending on the chosen \u03c4\u2014induce zero, one, multiple, or infinitely many \u03f5-NE for all \u03f5 \u2264 \u03f50. Corollary 1 underscores the sensitivity of exposure games to the temperature parameter \u03c4 , with uniformly homogeneous content at one end (high \u03c4 ), and potentially persistent oscillation behavior in competition when no NE exist (low \u03c4 ). A higher \u03c4 > 0 can be a result of algorithmic exploration (Chen et al., 2019; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2017; Lattimore & Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2020), which is provably necessary for optimal performance in static environments (Lattimore & Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2020). In contrast, our results show that in environments with strategic actors, exploration may incentivize content which is uniform and broadly appealing rather than diverse. This may contradict the intuition that more exploration should lead to greater content diversity due to the higher exposure of niche content. One way to understand this result is the tension between randomization and the ability of niche creators to reach their audience: producers may be discouraged from creating niche content when the algorithm is exploring too much (\u03c4 high), and encouraged to mercilessly seek and protect their own niche when the algorithm performs little exploration (\u03c4 low). Exploration effects are typically thought of as having negative impact on user experience through immediate reduction in quality of service as a result of suboptimal recommendations. However, the above results show secondary long-term effects. 2.3 LOCAL NASH EQUILIBRIA: In a local NE, each si is optimal on some of its neighborhood within the embedding space. Sometimes motivated as a form of bounded rationality, LNE can often be found by local search algorithms (e.g., Mazumdar et al., 2019). Since our motivation in studying exposure games is ultimately better system understanding and audits, we are particularly interested in these algorithmic benefits. Practical first-order algorithms for identifying LNE operate analogously to gradient descent, implying they may terminate in critical points that are not LNE. Unlike NE, critical points always exist. Proposition 2. Every \u03c4 > 0 exposure game with E[c] \u0338= 0 has a critical point at s1 = . . . = sn = c\u0304. As we have seen, s1 = . . . = sn = c\u0304 may be an equilibrium (Proposition 1). To distinguish LNE from mere critical points, we use the Riemannian second derivative test (Boumal, 2022). Definition 3. A point s in strategy space satisfies the second derivative test if \u2200i \u2208 [n] (1) the Riemannian gradient (I \u2212 sis\u22a4i )\u2207siui(s) are zero, and (2) the Riemannian Hessian (I \u2212 sis\u22a4i ) [ \u22072siui(s) ] (I \u2212 sis\u22a4i )\u2212 \u27e8si,\u2207siui(s)\u27e9(I \u2212 sis\u22a4i ) , is strictly negative definite in the subspace perpendicular to si. This condition is sufficient but not necessary for a critical point to be an LNE. The LNE that do satisfy Definition 3 are termed differentiable Nash equilibria (Ratliff et al., 2016; Balduzzi et al., 2018). The distinction can be understood as analogous to the flat minimum at zero of x4 compared with the more well-behaved x2. 3 PRE-DEPLOYMENT AUDIT OF STRATEGIC CREATOR INCENTIVES: Beyond regularly retraining on new data, online platforms continuously roll out algorithm updates. While A/B testing can detect changes in user metrics, like satisfaction or churn, prior to the full-scale deployment (Tang et al., 2010; Hohnhold et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Gordon et al., 2019), assessing the impact on content producers is comparatively harder due to the longer delay between the roll-out and corresponding content adaptation. Furthermore, since producers cannot be easily assigned to distinct treatment groups without limiting their content to only a subset of consumers, modern A/B testing methods must eschew making causal statements about producer impact (Nandy et al., 2021; HaThuc et al., 2020; Husz\u00e1r et al., 2022). Undesirable results including promulgation of junk and abusive content then have to be addressed via post-hoc measures like content filtration and moderation. A tool for ex-ante (pre-deployment) assessment of producer impact could thus limit the harm experienced by users, moderators, and other affected parties. We demonstrate how to utilize a creator behavior model for this purpose, using the exposure game as a concrete example. The incorporation of factorization-based algorithms in exposure games allows us to use real-world datasets and rating models. While exposure games have limitations as a behavior model, we believe our experiments provide a useful illustration of the insights the proposed audit can offer to platform developers. 3.1 SETUP: We use the MovieLens-100K and LastFM-360K datasets (Harper & Konstan, 2015; BertinMahieux et al., 2011; Shakespeare et al., 2020), implement our code in Python (van Rossum & Drake, 2009) and rely on numpy (Harris et al., 2020), scikit-surprise (Hug, 2020), pandas (pandas development team, 2020), matplotlib (Hunter, 2007), jupyter (Kluyver et al., 2016), reclab (Krauth et al., 2020), and JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) packages to fit probabilistic (PMF; Mnih & Salakhutdinov, 2007) and non-negative (NMF; Lee & Seung, 1999) matrix factorization. The models are trained to predict the user ratings (centered in the PMF case). To select regularization and learning rate, we performed a two-fold 90/10 split cross-validation separately on each dataset. The tuned recommenders were then fit on the full dataset, and the resulting user embeddings, {cj}j\u2208[m] \u2282 Rd, were used to construct the demand distribution Pc = 1m \u2211 j \u03b4cj , and evaluate the recommendation probabilities pi(c). Details in Appendix C.1. The only algorithm for finding NE in hardmax exposure games we know has exponential worstcase complexity. We thus focus on the softmax case. While search for general mixed NE is possible in special cases (Fudenberg & Kreps, 1993; Kaniovski & Young, 1995; Bena\u00efm & Hirsch, 1997), we are not aware of any technique applicable to n-player exposure games. We therefore focus on first-order methods and pure \u03f5-LNE (Section 2.3). We employ simple gradient ascent combined with reparametrization, where we set si = \u03b8i/\u2225\u03b8i\u2225 for each producer, and iteratively update \u03b8i,t = \u03b8i,t\u22121 + \u03b1\u2207\u03b8i,t\u22121ui(si,t\u22121, s\\i,t\u22121) for shared step size \u03b1 > 0, and \u2207\u03b8iui(s) = 1\u03c4\u2225\u03b8i\u22252 (I \u2212 sis \u22a4 i )E[pi(c)(1\u2212 pi(c))c] = 1\u2225\u03b8i\u22252 (I \u2212 sis \u22a4 i )\u2207siui(s) . (4) Equation (4) shows the update direction is parallel to the Riemannian gradient of ui(s) w.r.t. si \u2208 Sd\u22121 (Section 2.3). We also experimented with the related Riemannian gradient ascent optimizer (Boumal, 2022), but abandoned it after (predictably) observing little qualitative difference. We note that the local updates themselves define better-response dynamics linked to iterative minor content changes; investigation of their relation to real-world producer behavior is an interesting future direction. We investigate the sensitivity of the incentivized content to the: (i) rating model \u2208 {PMF, NMF}, (ii) embedding dimension d \u2208 {3, 50}, and (iii) temperature log10 \u03c4 \u2208 {\u22122,\u22121, 0}. We further vary the number of producers n \u2208 {10, 100} to examine scenarios with different producer to consumer ratios (user count is fixed to the full 943 for MovieLens, and 13,698 for LastFM). The above values were selected in a preliminary sweep as representative of the effects presented below. For every setting, we used five random seeds for initialization of the recommender (affects Pc), and for each ran the gradient ascent algorithm 10x to identify possible \u03f5-LNE. We applied early stopping when \u21132-change in parameters between iterations dipped below 10\u22128 \u00b7 \u221a d; the number of iterations was set to 50K so convergence was achieved for every run. We only report runs where the second-order Riemannian test from Section 2.3 did not rule out an \u03f5-LNE. Additional results, including those where the Riemannian test was conclusive, are in Appendix C.2. 3.2 RESULTS: Emergence of clusters with growing \u03c4 . Theorem 3 shows that producers concentrate around c\u0304 = E[c]/\u2225E[c]\u2225 for sufficiently high \u03c4 . Figure 4 corroborates the result on both MovieLens and LastFM, with the concentration happening already at \u03c4 = 1 regardless of the embedding dimension d and producer count n. We also see that lower \u03c4 can lead to \u201clocal clustering\u201d where only few producers converge onto the same strategy. We hypothesize that the simultaneous local updates of the consumers create \u201cattractor zones\u201d where close-by producers collapse onto each other; they will remain collapsed henceforth due to equality of their gradients (by symmetry). Theorem 3 does tell us collapse is to be expected for high \u03c4 , and it is possible that a local version of the result with more than one clusters is true for intermediate values of \u03c4 . This highlights how crucial the algorithmic choice of \u03c4 is for the induced incentives within our model. Targeting of incentivized content by gender. The MovieLens dataset contains binarized women/men user gender information. In Figure 5, we examine targeting of incentivized content on women and men. To do so, we employ aggregate statistics of predicted ratings. While predicted ratings may differ from actual user preferences, they do determine recommendations and thus user experience. Since the effect of \u03c4 on rating models varies, we also include baseline values (labeled by \u2018b\u2019) computed using the original learned item embeddings (i.e., item locations before strategic adaptation). Since the baseline embeddings need not satisfy the unit norm constraint (see Definition 1), we measure normalized ratings r\u0304i(c) := \u27e8c,si\u27e9 \u2225c\u2225\u2225si\u2225 to facilitate comparison. The normalization also alleviates the known issue of varying interpretation of ranking scales between users (Lynch Jr et al., 1991). Both plots in Figure 5 estimate a difference of group statistics \u2206 = \u03d5men \u2212 \u03d5women, where \u03d5G = medianc\u2208G{maxi\u2208[n] r\u0304i(c)} (left), and \u03d5G = 1n \u2211n i=1 1{argmaxc r\u0304i(c) \u2208 G} (right). The former is a user-centric metric measuring whether preferences of either group are more targeted by the new content. The latter statistic is producer-centric, measuring the proportion of producers who create content expected to be most liked by either women or men. In both cases, higher values signify content crafted towards male audience (users skew 71% to 29% male). Notably, higher embedding dimension results in higher bias, presumably due to the higher model expressivity, and thus option to create more targeted content. Interestingly, NMF consistently incentivizes more biased content. Association between incentivized content and creator gender. Platform developers may want to know if some creators are being disadvantaged (Chokshi, 2017; Farokhmanesh, 2018; Rodriguez, 2022). While solutions were proposed in the static case (e.g, Beutel et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021), understanding if the algorithm (de)incentivizes content by particular creator groups may limit future harm. In Figure 6, we measure the difference between the proportion of (left) and the median distance to (right) baseline creator embeddings (learned by the recommender before strategic adaptation), within increasingly large neighborhoods of each strategic si. Since the baseline embeddings need not be unit norm, we use the cosine distance to define the neighborhoods. Starting with the proportion (left), higher embedding dimension (more flexible model) incentivizes content more typical of male artists. This may be related to the higher prevalence of men in LastFM, combined with training by average loss minimization. The gender imbalance also explains why the proportion (left) stabilizes at a positive value, whereas the median distance (right) reverts to zero, as the number of considered neighbors grows. The bias is also related to the choice of rating model, where especially PMF at high temperatures results in significant advantage for male artists. 4 DISCUSSION: From social media and streaming to Google Search, many of us interact with recommender and information retrieval systems every day. While the core algorithms have been developed and analyzed years ago, the socio-economic context in which they operate received comparatively little attention in the academic literature. We make two main contributions: (a) we define exposure games, an incentivebased model of content creators\u2019 interactions with real-world algorithms including the popular matrix factorization and two-tower systems, and (b) we formulate a a pre-deployment audit which employs a model of creator behavior to identify misalignment between incentivized and desirable content. Our main theoretical contributions focus on the properties of Nash equilibria in exposure games. We found that seemingly innocuous algorithmic choices like temperature \u03c4 , embedding dimension d, or a non-negativity constraint on embeddings can have serious impact on the induced incentives. For example, high \u03c4 incentivizes uniform broadly appealing content, whereas low \u03c4 motivates targeting smaller consumer groups. Since higher \u03c4 is often linked to exploration, which is necessary for optimal performance in static settings (e.g., Lattimore & Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2020), this result highlights the importance of considering the socio-economic context in algorithm development. Our producer model has several limitations\u2014which we aim to address in the future\u2014from assuming rationality, complete information, and full control, to taking the skill set of each producer to be equivalent, their utility to be linear in total exposure, and ignoring algorithmic diversification of recommendations. We also consider the attention pool as fixed and finite, neglecting the problematic reality of the modern attention economy, where online platforms constantly struggle to increase their user numbers and daily usage (Covington et al., 2016; Williams, 2018; Bhargava & Velasquez, 2021). The empirical evaluation of our behavior model is hindered by the lack of academic access to the almost exclusively privately owned platforms (Greene et al., 2022). Due to their sizable influence on individuals, societies, and economy (Milano et al., 2020), information and recommender systems are of critical importance from an ethical and societal perspective. While we hope that a better understanding of the incentives these algorithms create will mitigate their negative social consequences, this also entails risks. Perhaps the most important is the possibility of employing an optimizer such as the one in Section 3 to game a real-world algorithm. This is especially relevant to the current debate about transparency (e.g., Sonboli et al., 2021; Rieder & Hofmann, 2020; Sinha & Swearingen, 2002), and the proposal to (partially) open-source the Twitter code base (Knight, 2022). Due to the aforementioned limitations, we also caution against treating the predictions of our incentive-based behavior model as definitive, especially given the significant complexity of many real-world algorithms and the environments in which they operate. Going forward, we want to deepen our understanding of exposure games, and make pre-deployment audits a practical addition to the algorithm auditing toolbox. We hope this research enriches the debate about online platforms by a useful perspective for thinking about harms, (over)amplification, and design of algorithms with regard to the relevant incentives of the involved actors. A PROOFS:  A.1 STAND-ALONE STATEMENTS: Theorem 2. PNE need not exist in either the hardmax (\u03c4 = 0) or softmax (\u03c4 > 0) exposure games. Proof of Theorem 2. (I) Hardmax: Take n = d = 2 and Pc = 13 \u22113 j=1 \u03b4cj where the angle between any cj \u0338= ck is 2\u03c03 . Place s1 anywhere on the circle. W.l.o.g. c1 = argmaxj\u27e8s1, cj\u27e9. Then there is v on the geodesic connecting c2 and c3 which has higher dot product with both c2 and c3 than s1. (II) Softmax: Let n = d = 2, and Pc = 13 (2\u03b4e1 + \u03b4e2) where e1 = [1, 0] \u22a4 and e2 = [0, 1]\u22a4. By Proposition 1, we know that the only possible PNE is s1 = s2 = c\u0304 \u221d E[c] = [2, 1]/3, where both players enjoy u1(s) = u2(s) = 12 . Let s \u2032 1 = (c\u0304 + \u03f5e1)/\u2225c\u0304 + \u03f5e1\u2225 for some \u03f5 > 0. As \u03c4 \u2192 0, u1(s \u2032 1, c\u0304) \u2192 23 by continuity. Hence \u2203\u03c40 > 0 s.t. s1 = s2 = c\u0304 is not a PNE for all \u03c4 < \u03c40. Theorem 3. For any \u03f5 > 0 and Pc \u2208 P(Rd) with compact support and E[c] \u0338= 0, \u2203\u03c40 > 0 s.t. s1 = . . . = sn = c\u0304 is an \u03f5-PNE for all \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c40. Moreover, for all \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c40, the smallest \u03f5\u03c4 for which c\u0304 is an \u03f5\u03c4 -PNE satisfies \u03f5\u03c4 \u2264 \u03f5\u03c4 . If also \u03f5 < \u2225c\u0302\u2225, then the set of better-responses to c\u0304 \u03a8(c\u0304) := {v \u2208 Sd\u22121 :u1(v, c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304) \u2265 u1(c\u0304, c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304)} , (3) is a subset of Bd\u03b4 (c\u0304) = {v : \u2225v \u2212 c\u0304\u2225 \u2264 \u03b4} with \u03b4 = 2\u03f5/(\u2225c\u0302\u2225 \u2212 \u03f5), and \u03b4 \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Proof of Theorem 3. We w.l.o.g. focus on the defection strategies for s1. By the mean-value theorem \u2206 := u1(s1, c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304)\u2212 u1(c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304) = \u27e8g\u20321, s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u27e9 , where g\u20321 = \u2207s\u20321u1(s\u20321, c\u0304, . . . , c\u0304) for some s\u20321 on the line connecting s1 and c\u0304. While the rigorous argument below relies on a few technicalities, the main idea is simple: as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, \u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321 \u2192 c\u0302 = 1 n (1\u2212 1n )E[c] uniformly over s1 \u2208 Sd\u22121 (Lemma 1), and thus \u03c4 \u00b7\u2206 \u2248 \u27e8c\u0302, s1\u2212 c\u0304\u27e9 \u2264 \u2225c\u0302\u2225(1\u2212 1) = 0. Lemma 1. lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e sups1\u2208Sd\u22121 \u2225\u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321 \u2212 c\u0302\u2225 \u2192 0 . Proof of Lemma 1. Since supp(Pc) is compact by assumption, and \u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321 = E[p1(c)(1 \u2212 p1(c))c], all we need is p1(c)(1\u2212 p1(c)) \u2192 1n (1\u2212 1n ) pointwise in c (dominated convergence), and uniform over s\u20321 \u2208 Bd = {v : \u2225v\u2225 \u2264 1} (mean-value theorem yields s\u20321 on the line connecting s1 with c\u0304). As s\u20321 7\u2192 \u2223\u2223p1(c)(1\u2212 p1(c))\u2212 1n (1\u2212 1n )\u2223\u2223 , with p1(c) = exp(\u03c4\u22121\u27e8c,s\u20321\u27e9)exp(\u03c4\u22121\u27e8c,s\u20321\u27e9)+(n\u22121) exp(\u03c4\u22121\u27e8c,c\u0304\u27e9) , is continuous, it is maximized by some (s\u22c61, c \u22c6) \u2208 Bd \u00d7 supp(Pc) (Tychonoff and compactness of supp(Pc)). By monotonicity, (s\u22c61, c \u22c6) will be a maximizer \u2200\u03c4 \u2032 \u2265 \u03c4 . Conclude by continuity. For any given \u03f5 > 0, Lemma 1 can be combined with \u03c4 \u00b7\u2206 \u2264 \u27e8c\u0302, s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u27e9+ \u2225\u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321 \u2212 c\u0302\u2225\u2225s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u2225 , where \u27e8c\u0302, s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u27e9 \u2264 0 for all s1 \u2208 Sd\u22121 by c\u0304 = c\u0302/\u2225c\u0302\u2225, to obtain \u2206 < \u03b5 for a sufficiently large \u03c4 . In particular, Lemma 1 yields a \u03c40 such that \u2225\u03c40 \u00b7 g\u20321 \u2212 c\u0302\u2225 \u2264 \u03f5/2, which ensures \u2225\u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321 \u2212 c\u0302\u2225\u2225s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u2225 \u2264 2\u2225\u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321 \u2212 c\u0302\u2225 \u2264 \u03f5 , for all \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c40. Hence c\u0304 is at least an \u03f5\u03c4 -PNE for all \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c40 (w.l.o.g. \u03c40 \u2265 1). The above can be used to obtain a bound on \u03b4 := \u2225s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u2225 for s1 \u2208 \u03a8(c\u0304). Using orthogonality \u2206 = \u27e8(I \u2212 c\u0304c\u0304\u22a4)g\u20321, s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u27e9+ \u27e8c\u0304, g\u20321\u27e9\u27e8c\u0304, s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u27e9 \u2264 \u03c4\u22121\u2225s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u2225 [\u2225\u2225(I \u2212 c\u0304c\u0304\u22a4)\u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321\u2225\u2225\u2212 12 \u27e8c\u0304, \u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321\u27e9 \u2225s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u2225] , by the triangle inequality, and \u27e8c\u0304, s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u27e9 = 12 (2\u27e8c\u0304, s1\u27e9 \u2212 2) = \u2212 12\u2225s1 \u2212 c\u0304\u22252 by s1, c\u0304 \u2208 Sd\u22121. Again by orthogonality, \u03f52 > \u2225\u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321 \u2212 c\u0302\u22252 = \u2225(I \u2212 c\u0304c\u0304\u22a4)\u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321\u2225+ |\u27e8c\u0304, \u03c4 \u00b7 g\u20321\u27e9 \u2212 \u2225c\u0302\u2225|2, which implies \u03c4 \u00b7\u2206 < \u03b4 [ \u03f5\u2212 \u03b42 (\u2225c\u0302\u2225 \u2212 \u03f5) ] . (5) The r.h.s. is positive only when 0 < \u03b4 < 2\u03f5/(\u2225c\u0302\u2225 \u2212 \u03f5). Since \u03f5 in Equation (5) is only used as an upper bound on \u2225\u03c4 \u00b7g\u20321\u2212 c\u0302\u2225, and Lemma 1 tells us this norm converges to zero, \u03b4 \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Proposition 1. A PNE always exists in n = d = 2 non-negative hardmax games, but may not without non-negativity or when d > 2. For n = 2 non-negative softmax games with c\u0302 := 1n (1\u2212 1n )E[c] \u0338= 0, the only possible PNE is s1 = s2 = c\u0304 with c\u0304 := c\u0302/\u2225c\u0302\u2225 (independently of d), but a PNE may not exist. When n > 2, non-negative softmax games can have a PNE other than s1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = sn = c\u0304. Proof of Proposition 1. (I) Hardmax: For existence when n = d = 2, let \u03b8c be the angle of c from (w.l.o.g.) [1, 0], and let A \u2282 C denote the set of angles such that for every \u03b8m \u2208 A, P(\u03b8c \u2264 \u03b8m) = 12 and P(\u03b8 \u2265 \u03b8m) = 12 , with P implied by the underlying Pc. Then any (s1, s2) \u2208 A\u00d7A is a PNE. For non-existence when d > 2, consider d = 3 and Pc = 13 \u22113 j=1 \u03b4cj where cj are the three canonical basis vectors. Disregards of s1 location, there will be a point on the great circle connecting the two most distant points from s1 (break ties arbitrarily) which is closer to both of the two. For non-existence without non-negativity in d = 2, see the hardmax part of the Theorem 2 proof. (II) Softmax: In the n = 2 case, a necessary condition for s = (s1, s2) to be a PNE is that the Riemannian gradients of the utility\u2014(I \u2212 sis\u22a4i )gi with gi = \u2207siui(s)\u2014are zero. Since \u2207siui(s) = \u03c4\u22121 E[pi(c)(1\u2212pi(c))c], gi belongs to the first orthant by the definition of the non-negative game, and it is not zero (for \u03c4 > 0, all probabilities lie in (0, 1), and c is not a.s. zero since we assumed E[c] \u0338= 0). Hence the Riemannian gradients can only be zero if si \u221d gi, and in particular si = gi/\u2225gi\u22252 because this is the direction which makes dot products with all vectors in the first orthant positive. Crucially, g1 = g2 in 2-player games due to the symmetry of p1(c)(1 \u2212 p1(c)) = p1(c)p2(c) = p2(c)(1 \u2212 p2(c)). Therefore at a PNE, s1 = s2 in which case pi(c) = 12 for all c, and thus gi(s) \u221d E[c], implying s1 = s2 = c\u0304 is the only possible PNE. To show it may not be a PNE, consider Pc = 1 3 (2\u03b4c1 + \u03b4c2) for arbitrary non-zero c1 \u0338= c2 in the first orthant. Then c\u0304 \u221d 2c1 + c2 with u1(c\u0304, c\u0304) = u2(c\u0304, c\u0304) = 1/2. Fixing s1 = c1/\u2225c1\u22252 and taking \u03c4 \u2193 0, we get u1(s1, c\u0304) \u2192 2/3, and thus there exists a \u03c4 > 0 for which s1 = c1/\u2225c1\u22252 is a strict improvement over s1 = c\u0304 when s2 = c\u0304. For the n > 2 case, we focus on a two-dimensional n = 4 game with Pc = 12 (\u03b4c1 + \u03b4c2) with c1 = [1, 0] \u22a4 and and c2 = [0, 1]\u22a4 (the two canonical basis vectors). In particular, we investigate existence NE of the form s1 = s2 and s3 = s4. Since d = 2, the strategies are restricted to S1, we can use polar coordinates to parameterize si = \u03c6(\u03b8i) := [cos(\u03b8i), sin(\u03b8i)]\u22a4. The maximum utility of each player in a NE is 1/4, since otherwise each of the two players in the less profitable location (say s1 = s2) could jump to the other location (s3 = s4), gaining utility \u2265 1/4. This narrows down our search to configurations where every player has utility equal to 1/4, which is only the case when \u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03b8 and \u03b83 = \u03b84 = \u03c02 \u2212 \u03b8 for some \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c04 ] =: K. We can thus define Q := ( 0 \u22121 1 0 ) , and look for which values of \u03b8 \u2208 K does (w.l.o.g.) \u2207\u03b81u1(s) = \u27e8g1, Qs1\u27e9 equal zero. Lemma 2. For a sufficiently small \u03c4 > 0, f : \u03b8 7\u2192 \u27e8g1(s), Qs1\u27e9 is strictly convex on K. Proof of Lemma 2. It is sufficient to prove that f \u2032\u2032 > 0 on K. For this, observe f \u2032(\u03b8) = \u2225Qs1\u22252H1 \u2212 \u27e8g1, s1\u27e9 where H1 := \u22072s1u1(s), and f \u2032\u2032(\u03b8) = \u2225Qs1\u22252\u2207\u03b81H1 \u2212\u27e8Qs1, 3H1s1+g1\u27e9 \u2265 \u2225Qs1\u2225 2 \u2207\u03b81H1 \u2212 3\u2225H1\u22252 \u2212 \u2225g1\u22252, where by construction g1 = 1 2\u03c4 ( p1(c1)(1 \u2212 p1(c1)) p1(c2)(1 \u2212 p1(c2)) ) , H1 = 1 2\u03c42 ( (1 \u2212 2p1(c1))p1(c1)(1 \u2212 p1(c1)) 0 0 (1 \u2212 2p1(c2))p1(c2)(1 \u2212 p1(c2)) ) \u2207\u03b81H1 = 12\u03c43 ( (1 \u2212 6p1(c1)(1 \u2212 p1(c1))p1(c1)(1 \u2212 p1(c1)) 0 0 (1 \u2212 6p1(c2)(1 \u2212 p1(c2))p1(c2)(1 \u2212 p1(c2)) ) , Hence \u2225Qs1\u22252\u2207\u03b81H1 \u223c \u03c4 \u22123, \u2225H1\u22252 \u223c \u03c4\u22122, and \u2225g1\u22252 \u223c \u03c4\u22121, implying that for \u03c4 low enough, the positive term \u2225Qs1\u22252\u2207\u03b81H1 dominates (using that all expressions share the term p1(c)(1 \u2212 p1(c)), and thus after dividing and observing \u03c4 \u2192 0 gives p1(c) close to either one or zero, we get that all the terms scale as p1(c)(1\u2212 p1(c))/\u03c4k for the appropriate k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}). Lemma 2 implies there are at most two NE (f is strictly convex, and f(\u03b8) = 0 is a necessary condition). At \u03b8 = \u03c04 , s1 = s2 = s3 = s4 = c\u0304 by definition, which we know is a critical point, so f(\u03c04 ) = 0. Since g1 \u221d E[p1(c)(1 \u2212 p1(c))c] \u0338= 0 for any \u03c4 > 0 (c cannot be a.s. 0 by E[c] \u0338= 0 and the non-negativity assumption), f(0) = \u27e8g1, Qs1\u27e9 > 0 (s1 = \u03c6(0) = e1 = [1, 0]\u22a4). The other possible root of f thus could only be in the interior (0, \u03c04 ) of K. Since f is negative when moving towards e1 = [1, 0]\u22a4 increases utility, we can see for example f(\u03c08 ) < 0 if \u03c4 is sufficiently small. Hence there exists \u03c4 > 0 and \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 \u2208 (0, \u03c08 ) s.t. f(\u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ) = 0 by the mean value theorem. So far we have established that s1 = s2 = \u03c6(\u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ), s3 = s4 = \u03c6( \u03c0 2 \u2212 \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ) is a local NE for the corresponding small \u03c4 . By symmetry, it is sufficient to check if there is a defection strategy for s1. Any defection to \u03b81 \u2208 (\u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 , \u03c02 \u2212 \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ] will result in p1(c) < 14 for both c = c1, c2, and thus worse utility. Defection to (\u03c02 \u2212 \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 , \u03c02 ] will not yield utility greater than defection to [0, \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ) since s3 = s4 = \u03c6( \u03c0 2 \u2212 \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ), so it is sufficient to focus on \u03b81 \u2208 [0, \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ). Here \u2207\u03b81u1(s) = \u27e8g1, Qs1\u27e9 \u221d p1(c2)(1\u2212 p1(c2)) cos(\u03b81)\u2212 p1(c1)(1\u2212 p1(c1)) sin(\u03b81) \u2265 p1(c1)(1\u2212 p1(c1))[cos(\u03b81)\u2212 sin(\u03b81)] , since p1(c1) grows quicker than p1(c2) decays. By construction, \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 < \u03c0 4 , and we know cos(\u03b8) \u2212 sin(\u03b8) > 0 for \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c04 ). In other words, the utility of s1 is strictly increasing on \u03b81 \u2208 [0, \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ), i.e., none of the corresponding s1 = \u03c6(\u03b81) is an improvement. Hence s1 = s2 = \u03c6(\u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ), s3 = s4 = \u03c6(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03b8\u22c6\u03c4 ) is a NE. (The construction is illustrated in Figure 7.) A.2 INLINE STATEMENTS Lemma 3. The distribution from the part (I) of the proof of Theorem 2\u2014d = 2, Pc = 13 \u22113 j=1 \u03b4cj with cj \u0338= ck 2\u03c03 apart\u2014admits a mixed NE P1 = P2 = Pc at \u03c4 = 0. Proof of Lemma 3. By symmetry, ui(Pc, Pc) = 12 , \u2200i. Since for any s1 \u2208 supp(Pc) = {c1, c2, c3} Ec,s2 [u1(s1, s2) | s1] = 13 [u1(s1, c1) + u1(s1, c2) + u1(s1, c3)] = 13 [1 \u00b7 12 + 2 \u00b7 13 (1 + 12 + 0)] = 12 , all we need is to show that Ec,s2 [u1(s1, s2) | s1] \u2264 12 for any s1 /\u2208 supp(Pc). W.l.o.g. assume s1 lies on the geodesic connecting c1 and c3 (i.e., on the arc opposite of c2). Such an s1 is closer to c1 and c3 then c2 (u1(s1, c2) = 23 ), but is further from c1 and c2 (resp. c3 and c2) than c1 (resp. c3). Hence Ec,s2 [u1(s1, s2) | s1] = 13 [u1(s1, c1) + u1(s1, c2) + u1(s1, c3)] = 13 [1 \u00b7 23 + 2 \u00b7 13 ] = 49 . Since 49 < 1 2 , s1 has no incentive to move any of its mass away from supp(Pc). B HARDMAX GAMES: In this section we present two different algorithms for finding mixed Nash equilibria in two-player hardmax games. We note that the set of allowable mixed strategies must be restricted in some way since certain distributions with support on the unit-sphere Sd\u22121 require infinite storage. Hence, our first algorithm finds a mixed NE for a discretized strategy space, while our second algorithm considers settings where Pc is discrete and finds a mixed NE with support over a finite number of pure strategies in the original non-discretized space, assuming such a mixed NE exists. We caution that both of these algorithms can only find mixed NE for small exposure games due to their poor scaling properties. We list them here to highlight the difficulty of solving hardmax games when compared to the softmax setting and to serve as inspiration for future research into more efficient algorithms. B.1 DISCRETIZED GAMES: We first consider the setting where both players may only choose mixed strategies with support over a finite subset A = {s(1), s(2), . . . , s(m)} \u2282 Sd\u22121 of pure strategies. This setting includes embeddings that are represented using floating point numbers although A will be very large. In this case the mixed strategy of the players can be expressed as an m-dimensional probability vector \u03c0i with \u03c0ij = Pi ( s(j) ) . Since there are a finite set of pure strategies a mixed NE is guaranteed to exist (Nash Jr, 1950). Furthermore since this is a two-player constant-sum game we can find a mixed NE by solving the following linear program (Dorfman, 1951) maximize \u03b1 \u03b1 subject to Ux \u2265 \u03b11 1\u22a4x = 1 xi \u2265 0, i = 1, . . . ,m, where Uij = u1 ( s(i), s(j)) ) . Then the strategies where \u03c01 = \u03c02 = x, correspond to a mixed NE. While such a problem is simple to formulate and solve, the number of possible strategies will grow rapidly as d increases for most discretization schemes. For example, we might create a uniform grid of k points over each spherical coordinate, in which case we will have m = kd\u22121 pure strategies to consider. B.2 FINITE SUPPORT: Next, we consider the setting where both players choose mixed strategies with support over at most m pure strategies and the support of Pc is over l points, supp(Pc) = {c1, c2, . . . , cl}. Unlike the discretized case however, the players may choose any pure strategy that lies on Sd\u22121. We begin by outlining a method that, given a mixed strategy P , finds all pure strategies D that dominate it: Es1\u223cP [u1(s1, s2)\u2212 u2(s1, s2)] < 0 for all s2 \u2208 D. Where we assume Player 1 provides the mixed strategy without loss of generality by symmetry. We will then use this method as a subroutine to find mixed nash equilibria. Lemma 4. (P1, P2) is a mixed NE if and only if Es1\u223cP1 [u1(s1, s)] \u2265 12 and Es2\u223cP2 [u2(s, s2)] \u2265 12 for all pure strategies s \u2208 Sd\u22121. Proof of Lemma 4. Assume (P1, P2) is a mixed NE, then by definition E(s1,s2)\u223c(P1,P )[u1(s1, s2)] \u2265 1 2 for all mixed strategies P \u2208 P(Sd\u22121), since each pure strategy is also a mixed strategy it follows that Es1\u223c(P1,s)[u1(s1, s)] \u2265 12 for all s \u2208 Sd\u22121. Similarly for Player 2. Now assume we have two mixed strategies (P1, P2) such that Es1\u223cP1 [u1(s1, s)] \u2265 12 and Es2\u223cP2 [u2(s, s2)] \u2265 12 for all s \u2208 Sd\u22121. Given a mixed strategy P \u2208 P(Sd\u22121) it follows that E(s1,s2)\u223c(P1,P )[u1(s1, s2)] = Es2\u223cP [Es1\u223cP1 [u1(s1, s2)]] = \u222b Sd\u22121 Es1\u223cP1 [u1(s1, s2)]dP (s2) \u2265 \u222b Sd\u22121 1 2 dP (s2) = 1 2 . Similarly for Player 2. Lemma 4 allows us to only consider pure strategies when checking if strategies are mixed NE. Now given a mixed strategy P with finite support supp(P ) = {s(1), s(2), . . . , s(m)} we can find every subset of Sd\u22121 that does not satisfy the condition in Lemma 4. Each s(i) partitions Sd\u22121 into 3l disjoint partitions X (i) = {X(i)1 , X (i) 2 , . . . , X (i) 3l }, with X(i)j satisfying jk =  2 if \u27e8s(i), ck\u27e9 > \u27e8s, ck\u27e9 1 if \u27e8s(i), ck\u27e9 = \u27e8s, ck\u27e9 0 if \u27e8s(i), ck\u27e9 < \u27e8s, ck\u27e9, for all pure strategies s \u2208 X(i)j , where jk is the k-th digit in the ternary representation of j. We can further partition the space into 3lm disjoint partitions Y = {Y1, Y2, . . . , Y3lm} with Yi = \u22c2m j=1 X (j) ij where ij is the j-th digit of the 3l-ary representation of i. For every Y \u2208 Y we have Es1\u223cP [u1(s1, s)] = Es1\u223cP [u1(s1, s\u2032)] for all s, s\u2032 \u2208 Y by construction. Thus, we can find the set of all pure strategies D that dominate P by iterating over Y , testing a single point in each partition, and taking unions: Z = { Y \u2208 Y : s \u2208 Y =\u21d2 Es1\u223cP [u1(s1, s)] < 1 2 } , D = \u22c3 Y \u2208Z Y. It follows from Lemma 4 that (P, P ) is a mixed NE if and only if D is empty. Finally, we outline a method to find mixed NE. We first note that for every positive integer m, every pure strategy s \u2208 Sd\u22121 defines a feasible set Fs of all mixed strategies with support over at most m pure strategies that are not dominated by s, that is: Fs = { P = m\u2211 i=1 \u03c0i\u03b4s(i) : m\u2211 i=1 \u03c0iu1(s (i), s) \u2265 1 2 } , where \u03c0 is an m-dimensional probability vector. It follows from Lemma 4 that if P is mixed strategy with support over at most m points then (P, P ) is a mixed NE if and only if P \u2208 \u22c2s\u2208Sd\u22121 Fs. We can frame finding such a strategy P as an optimization problem minimize P\u2282P |P| subject to P \u2229 Fs \u0338= \u2205, s \u2208 Sd\u22121, where P is the set of all mixed strategies with support over at most m pure strategies. An optimal solution with more than one element in P indicates that there does not exist a mixed strategy with support over m points or fewer, whereas if |P| = 1 then (P, P ) is a mixed strategy where P is the singleton element in P. This is an instance of the implicit hitting set problem. Hence, we can use the algorithm proposed in Section 2.1 of Chandrasekaran et al. (2011) to solve the above optimization problem. Their algorithm assumes an oracle that, given a proposed subset P \u2286 P will return a subset Fs that is not hit P \u2229 Fs = \u2205 or will certify P as a feasible solution to the above optimization problem. We can easily achieve this by finding all dominating pure NE using our proposed method above for each P \u2208 P and taking the intersection of the resulting sets. If the intersection is empty then P is a feasible solution, otherwise every element in the intersection represents a subset Fs that has not been hit by P. C EXPERIMENTS:  C.1 SETUP: The LastFM dataset was preprocessed by Shakespeare et al. (2020). Original larger scale sweep was executed with n \u2208 {10, 25, 100, 500, 1500}, d \u2208 {3, 10, 50, 100}, stepsize in {10\u22123, 10\u22122, 10\u22121}, and \u03c4 \u2208 {10\u22122, 10\u22121, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0}. We only used 2 random seeds for the recommender, and 3 random seeds for our LNE-finding algorithm (i.e., 6 runs in total per configuration). For the reported results, stepsize sweep was restricted to{10\u22122, 10\u22121}; the number of steps was upper bounded by 50,000 (all runs have successfully converged to a fixed point as mentioned). While our code contains an option to scale_lr_by_temperature (see the config.py file in the provided code), which multiplies the stepsize by \u03c4 before its use, we did not use this option in the experiments. The second-order Riemannian test (Definition 3) is implemented in manifold.py. Defining the tangent space projection \u03a0i := (I \u2212 sis\u22a4i ), we consider a candidate strategy profile s \u2208 (Sd\u22121)n as violating the second order test if any of the Riemannian gradients \u03a0i\u2207siui(s) had \u21132-norm higher than 10\u22125 \u00b7 \u221a d, or the Riemannian Hessian \u03a0i[\u22072siui(s)]\u03a0i\u2212\u27e8si,\u2207siui(s)\u27e9\u03a0i had a strictly positive eigenvalue (no tolerance used here). The final MovieLens and LastFM experiments were run on 72 AWS machines, each with 4 CPU cores, for 5 hours. Including preliminary and failed runs, we used over 50K CPU hours. C.2 ADDITIONAL PLOTS: Appendix C.2.1 contains plots where the second-order test confirmed and LNE. Appendix C.2.2 then offers comparison to a third ranking algorithm: standard matrix factorization (MF; Koren et al., 2009), i.e., PMF with additional bias terms. The bias terms effect interpretation of \u03c4 values, and we also ignore them when running the LNE-finding algorithm. This makes the comparison with PMF and NMF difficult, which is why we excluded MF from the main text. Results in Appendix C.2.2 again contain runs where the second-order test did not rule out a LNE. C.2.1 LNE CONFIRMED BY THE SECOND-ORDER TEST: As mentioned, the plots shown in the main body of the paper are for runs where the second-order Riemannian test did not rule out that the found pure strategy profile is a LNE. Here we show exactly the same plots with only the runs where the test confirmed a LNE. The difference is that here we exclude the runs where the Riemannian Hessian had at least one zero eigenvalue associated with a direction perpendicular to si, for at least one i \u2208 [n]. As you see below, this had little effect on the LastFM results, but has non-negligibly reduced the number of admitted runs for MovieLens.
