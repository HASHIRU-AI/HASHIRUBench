The paper title is: Statistical Theory of Differentially Private Marginal-based Data Synthesis Algorithms\n\nNone: Marginal-based methods achieve promising performance in the synthetic data competition hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). To deal with high-dimensional data, the distribution of synthetic data is represented by a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., a Bayesian network), while the raw data distribution is approximated by a collection of low-dimensional marginals. Differential privacy (DP) is guaranteed by introducing random noise to each lowdimensional marginal distribution. Despite its promising performance in practice, the statistical properties of marginal-based methods are rarely studied in the literature. In this paper, we study DP data synthesis algorithms based on Bayesian networks (BN) from a statistical perspective. We establish a rigorous accuracy guarantee for BN-based algorithms, where the errors are measured by the total variation (TV) distance or the L2 distance. Related to downstream machine learning tasks, an upper bound for the utility error of the DP synthetic data is also derived. To complete the picture, we establish a lower bound for TV accuracy that holds for every \u03f5-DP synthetic data generator. 1 INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has become increasingly important and differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006) appears as the foundation of data privacy. Differential privacy (DP) techniques are widely adopted by industrial companies and the U.S. Census Bureau (Johnson et al., 2017; Erlingsson et al., 2014; Nguye\u0302n et al., 2016; The U.S. Census Bureau, 2020; Abowd, 2018). One important method to protect data privacy is differentially private data synthesis (DPDS). In the setting of DPDS, a synthetic dataset is generated by some DP data synthesis algorithms from a real dataset. Then, one can release the synthetic dataset and the real dataset will be protected. Recently, National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) organized the differential privacy synthetic data competition (NIST, 2018; 2019; 2020-2021). In the NIST competition, the state-ofthe-art algorithms are marginal-based (McKenna et al., 2021), where the synthetic dataset is drawn from a noisy marginal distribution estimated by the real dataset. To deal with high-dimensional data, the distribution is usually modeled by the probabilistic graphical model (PGM) such as the Bayesian networks or Markov random fields (Jordan, 1999; Wainwright et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2017; Mckenna et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2021). Despite its empirical success in releasing high-dimensional data, as far as we know, the theoretical guarantee of marginal-based DPDS approaches is rarely studied in literature. In this paper, we focus on a DPDS algorithm based on the Bayesian networks (BN) known as the PrivBayes (Zhang et al., 2017) that is widely used in synthesizing sparse data (sparsity measured by the degree of a BN that will be defined later). A BN is a directed acyclic graph where each vertex is a low-dimensional marginal distribution and each edge is the conditional distribution between two vertices. It approximates the high-dimensional distribution of the raw data with a set of well-chosen low-dimensional distributions. Random noise is added to each low-dimensional marginal to achieve differential privacy. We aim to analyze the marginal-based approach from a statistical perspective and measure the accuracy of PrivBayes under different statistical distances including the total variation distance or the L2 distance. Another metric of synthetic data we are interested in is the utility metric related to downstream machine learning tasks. Empirical evaluation of synthetic data in downstream machine learning tasks is widely studied in literature. Existing utility metrics include Train on Synthetic data and Test on Real data (TSTR, (Esteban et al., 2017)) and Synthetic Ranking Agreement (SRA, (Jordon et al., 2018)). To our best knowledge, most of these utility evaluation methods are empirical without a theoretical guarantee. Establishing the statistical learning theory of synthetic data is another concern of this paper. Precisely, we focus on the statistical theory of PrivBayes based on the TSTR error. Our contributions. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we theoretically analyze the marginalbased synthetic data generation and derive an upper bound on the TV distance and L2 distance between real data and synthetic data. The upper bounds show that the Bayesian network structure mitigates the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. An upper bound for the sparsity of real data is also derived from the accuracy bounds. Second, we evaluate the utility of the synthetic data from downstream supervised learning tasks theoretically. Precisely, we bound the TSTR error between the predictors trained on real data and synthetic data. Third, we establish a lower bound for the TV distance between the synthetic data distribution and the real data distribution. 1.1 RELATED WORKS AND COMPARISONS: Broadly speaking, our work is related to a vast body of work in differential privacy (Dinur & Nissim, 2003; Dwork & Nissim, 2004; Blum et al., 2005; Dwork et al., 2007; Nissim et al., 2007; Barak et al., 2007; McSherry & Talwar, 2007; Machanavajjhala et al., 2008; Dwork et al., 2015). For example, McSherry & Talwar (2007) proposed the exponential mechanism that is widely used in practice. Machanavajjhala et al. (2008) discussed privacy for histogram data by sampling from the perturbed cell probabilities. However, these methods are not efficient for releasing high-dimensional tabular data, since the domain size grows exponentially in the dimension (which is known as \u201cthe curse of dimensionality\u201d). The state-of-art method for this problem is the marginal-based approach (Zhang et al., 2017; Qardaji et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021). Zhang et al. (2017) approximated the raw dataset by a sparse Bayesian network and then added noise to each vertex in the graph. Zhang et al. (2021) selected a collection of 2-way marginals and a gradually updating method was applied to release synthetic data. Although most of them provide rigorous privacy guarantees, theoretical analysis on accuracy is rare. Wasserman & Zhou (2010) established a statistical framework of DP and derived the accuracy of distribution estimated by noisy histograms. Our setting is different from theirs. Precisely, we analyze how noise addition and post-processing affect the conditional distribution (Lemma 6.2). Moreover, our proof handles the non-trivial interaction between the Bayesian network and noise addition. Our lower bound (Theorem 5.1) is related to existing results of the worst case lower bounds under the DP constraint in literature (Hardt & Talwar, 2010; Ullman, 2013; Bassily et al., 2014; Steinke & Ullman, 2017). Hardt & Talwar (2010) established lower bounds for the accuracy of answering linear queries with privacy budget \u03f5. Ullman (2013) derived the worst-case result that in general, it is NP-hard to release private synthetic data which accurately preserves all two-dimensional marginals. Bassily et al. (2014) built on their result and further developed lower bounds for the excess risk for every (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP algorithm. Our result is novel since we consider private synthetic data and the corresponding TV accuracy. Existing results for linear quires are not directly applicable to TV accuracy since they heavily rely on the linear structure. 2 DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: Differential privacy requires that any particular element in the raw dataset has a limited influence on the output (Dwork et al., 2006). The definition is formalized as follows. Here the data domain is denoted as \u2126. Definition 2.1 ((\u03f5, \u03b4)-differential privacy). Let A : \u2126n \u2192 R be a randomized algorithm that takes a dataset of size n as input, where the output space R is a probability space. For every \u03f5, \u03b4 \u2265 0, A satisfies (\u03f5, \u03b4)- differential privacy if for every two adjacent datasets D1 and D2, we have P[A(D1) \u2208 S] \u2264 exp(\u03f5)P[A(D2) \u2208 S] + \u03b4, for all measurable S \u2286 R. Here D1 and D2 are datasets of size n. We say that they are adjacent if they differ only on a single element, denoted as D1 \u2243 D2. For \u03b4 = 0, we abbreviate the definition as \u03f5-differential privacy (\u03f5-DP). A widely used metamechanism to ensure \u03f5-DP is the Laplace mechanism. The Laplace mechanism privatizes a function f on the dataset D by adding i.i.d. Laplace noises (denoted as \u03b7 \u223c Lap(\u03bb) ) to each output value of f(D). Here the probability density function of \u03b7 is given by P[\u03b7 = x] = 12\u03bb exp( \u2212|x| \u03bb ). Dwork & Nissim (2004) show that it ensures \u03f5-DP when \u03bb \u2265 \u2206f/\u03f5, where \u2206f is the L1 sensitivity of f : \u2206f = max (D1,D2):D1\u2243D2 \u2225f(D1)\u2212 f(D2)\u22251 . 3 MARGINAL-BASED DATA SYNTHESIS ALGORITHMS: In this section, we introduce DP marginal-based methods. For simplicity, we consider Boolean data where \u2126 = {0, 1}d and |\u2126| = 2d. It\u2019s obvious that our theory can be generalized to any categorical dataset with a finite domain size. 3.1 DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE ESTIMATE OF LOW-DIMENSIONAL MARGINAL DISTRIBUTIONS: Given a dataset D = {x(i)}ni=1 \u2282 \u2126n drawn independently from a distribution, the probability mass function is estimated by pD(x) = 1 n n\u2211 i=1 1[x(i) = x], for all x \u2208 \u2126. (1) Noise addition and post processing. We then sanitize pD(x) by the Laplace mechanism. Note that the sensitivity of pD(x) is 1/n. Then, we define p\u0303D = pD + Lap(1/(n\u03f5)) and p\u0303D is \u03f5-DP. Adding noise leads to inconsistency. To be specific, some estimated probabilities may be negative and the overall summation may not be 1. The following two kinds of post processing methods to address the inconsistency are widely adopted in marginal-based methods (cf., (Mckenna et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017)). Normalization. We convert all the negative probabilities to zeros, and then normalize all the probabilities by a scalar such that their summation is 1. L2-projection. We project the inconsistent distribution onto the probability simplex using the L2 metric. Specifically, for an inconsistent distribution (a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , am), the output is (b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bm) := argmin b\u0303i\u22650, \u2211 b\u0303i=1 m\u2211 i=1 (ai \u2212 b\u0303i)2. 3.2 MARGINAL SELECTION AND BAYESIAN NETWORKS: It is well-known that marginal-based methods have the curse of dimensionality. One way to mitigate the curse of dimensionality is adopting Bayesian networks (Zhang et al., 2017). Marginal selection. We first disassemble the raw dataset into a group of lower dimensional marginal datasets. Precisely, PrivBayes (Zhang et al., 2017) uses a sparse Bayesian network {x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd} to approximate the raw data. Each node xi corresponds to an attribute, and each edge from xj to xi represents P[xi | xj ], which is the probability of xj causing xi. We denote \u03a0i := {j | xj \u2192 xi}, which is the collection of all the attributes that affect xi. Zhang et al. (2017) also make the following assumptions on the network structure. Here k is a pre-fixed parameter that is much smaller than d. Assumption 3.1 (Sparsity). The degree of the Bayesian network is no more than k. Precisely, for any i, the size of \u03a0i is no more than k. The second assumption ensures that the graph cannot contain loops, which aids sampling from the graph. Assumption 3.2. For any i, we have \u03a0i \u2282 {x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xi\u22121}. For example, the Bayesian network in Figure 1 satisfies Assumption 3.1 for k = 2 and Assumption 3.2. The joint distribution is P(5 | 4, 3)P(4 | 3, 2)P(3 | 2, 1)P(2 | 1). DP Bayesian networks. In a Bayesian network, each low-dimensional marginal distribution P(xi,\u03a0i) is estimated by the marginal function defined by (1). For privacy consideration, we add Laplace noise Lap(d/n\u03f5) to the marginal P(xi,\u03a0i) and obtain the DP distribution P\u0302[xi,\u03a0i] by using post processing to the noisy marginal. Then the overall privacy budget can be calculated by the composition property of DP (Dwork, 2008; Zhang et al., 2017) and is \u03f5. Generating synthetic data. The loop-free Bayesian network provides an efficient sampling approach. Precisely, we draw xi from P\u0302[xi | \u03a0i] in an increasing order of i. Recall that Assumption 3.2 ensures that xj /\u2208 \u03a0i for any j>i. Therefore, by the time xi is to be sampled, all nodes in \u03a0i must have been sampled. This verifies that the sampling approach is practical. Moreover, sampling xi only needs the marginal P\u0302[xi,\u03a0i], instead of the full distribution. By Assumption 3.1, it is a marginal with size less than k + 1. This leads to a small computational load since k is small. With this sampling method, one (Zhang et al., 2017) can show that the synthetic private distribution is P\u0302[x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd] = \u220fd i=1 P\u0302[xi | \u03a0i]. 4 ACCURACY OF PRIVBAYES: In this section, we develop some theoretical results of the accuracy of PrivBayes. We discuss the proof of these results briefly in Section 6. 4.1 STATISTICAL DISTANCES: The goal of this subsection is to establish the accuracy guarantee for PrivBayes with different postprocessing methods: normalization and L2-projection. By the term \u201caccuracy\u201d, we mean the TV or the L2 distance between the synthetic distribution and the raw data distribution, respectively. Note that the error comes from two sources: 1) approximating the raw data by a Bayesian network that satisfies Assumption 3.1 and Assumption 3.2 , 2) adding noise and post processing. The first error, however, only relies on the sparsity of the raw data. Since we aim to establish our result for general raw data, we only focus on the second one. Therefore, it is natural for us to make the following assumption. Assumption 4.1. We assume the raw data distribution can be represented by a Bayesian network with d vertices that satisfies Assumption 3.1 and Assumption 3.2. With this assumption, PrivBayes (normalization) has the following accuracy guarantee. Theorem 4.1. Assuming that the raw dataset D is Boolean and satisfies Assumption 4.1, then we have \u2225\u2225\u2225P\u0302\u2212 P\u2225\u2225\u2225 TV \u2264 12d 22k(k + 1) n\u03f5 log 2d \u03b4 , with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 (with respect to the randomness of the Laplace mechanism and the same below). Here P is the empirical distribution of D and P\u0302 is the output of PrivBayes (normalization) with privacy budget \u03f5. Proof. See Section 6 for a proof sketch. The other post-processing method (L2-projection) we studied is also efficient. The following result verifies that PrivBayes (L2-projection) enjoys the similar accuracy guarantee in terms of the L2 distance. Here, with a little bit abuse of notations, we denote the L2 distance between two distributions as the L2 distance between their density functions. Theorem 4.2. Assuming the raw datasetD is Boolean and Assumption 4.1 is satisfied, then we have\u2225\u2225\u2225P\u0302\u2212 P\u2225\u2225\u2225 L2 \u2264 12d 22k(k + 1) n\u03f5 log 2d \u03b4 , with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Here P is the empirical distribution of D and P\u0302 is the output of PrivBayes (L2-projection) with privacy budget \u03f5. Proof. The proof is similar to Theorem 4.1. However it is still non-trivial and we discuss it in detail in Appendix B. Discussion. Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 achieves a bound that is consistent (tends to 0 as n tends to infinity) if k \u226a log2(n\u03f5/d2). Moreover, a smaller k leads to smaller upper bounds. Since we assume that the real data and synthetic data share the same k, we conclude that PrivBayes achieve better performance on sparser real datasets. The size of k is often rather small in real application. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) chose k \u2264 4 in the simulation. Theorem 4.1 also characterizes the reliance on the privacy budget \u03f5. Precisely, tighter privacy budget means better privacy guarantee, but leads to worse performance. Moreover, our rate is polynomial in the dimension d. Comparing with directly applying the Laplace mechanism to the whole domain (see Theorem 4.3), our result shows that by heavily deploying the network structure, the Bayesian network exponentially refines the rate. Theorem 4.3. Assuming that the raw dataset D is Boolean, then we have\u2225\u2225\u2225P\u0303\u2212 P\u2225\u2225\u2225 TV \u2264 2 d n\u03f5 log 2 \u03b4 , with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Here P\u0303 is the synthetic distribution generated by directly applying Laplace mechanism to the entire domain. Proof. By the definition of Laplace mechanism, we add i.i.d. Lap(1/n\u03f5) noise to all the 2d choices of P(x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd) and then normalize them.Then, Theorem 4.3 can be proved similarly as Lemma 6.1 with m = 2d. 4.2 UTILITY ERRORS: In real world practice, the raw training data in supervised learning may contain sensitive information, like personal preference of users. Therefore, it is not allowed to be released to the public. An alternative is to release differentially private synthetic data instead of the raw data. A central problem is the \u201cutility\u201d of synthetic training data, which means the evaluation of synthetic data in downstream tasks. We explain the term utility in detail below. Consider a dataset D = {x(i)}ni=1 drawn from the domain \u2126 with sample size n. We denote its corresponding synthetic dataset as D\u0302 = {x\u0302(i)}n\u0302i=1 of size n\u0302. We use the empirical risk minimization (ERM) model to capture the supervised learning. Precisely, the ERM estimators for the raw dataset D and the synthetic data D\u0302 are defined as \u03b8\u0302 = argmin \u03b8\u2208C 1 n n\u2211 i=1 \u2113(\u03b8, x(i)) + \u03bbJ(\u03b8), \u03b8\u0302syn = argmin \u03b8\u2208C 1 n\u0302 n\u0302\u2211 i=1 \u2113(\u03b8, x\u0302(i)) + \u03bbJ(\u03b8), (2) respectively. Here C is a convex closed set. We assume the loss function \u2113(\u00b7, x) is convex on C and is L-Lipschitz in x for some L \u2265 0. The regularization term J(\u00b7) is adopted to prevent over-fitting. The model captures a wide range of applications. For example, given a data point x(i) = (ui, vi) \u2208 {0, 1}d+1, by defining the hinge loss \u2113(\u03b8, x(i)) = (1\u2212\u27e8\u03b8, ui\u27e9 \u00b7 vi)+, we recover the popular support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The loss is \u221a d+ 1-Lipschitz in \u03b8 since \u2225\u2225x(i)\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 \u221a d+ 1. The utility of the synthetic dataset D\u0302 measures whether \u03b8\u0302syn and \u03b8\u0302 perform similarly on the prediction task (Esteban et al., 2017). To be specific, the following metric is used to evaluate the utility, U(D\u0302,D) := 1 n \u2223\u2223\u2223R(\u03b8\u0302)\u2212R(\u03b8\u0302syn)\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (3) where R(\u03b8) = \u2211n i=1 \u2113(\u03b8, x (i)) is the empirical risk on D ((Rankin et al., 2020; Hittmeir et al., 2019)). Intuitively, the asymptotic behavior of U(D\u0302,D) is affected by the difference between distributions of synthetic data and true data. This fact is characterized in Theorem 4.4. We first make the following assumption on the bound of the loss function \u2113(\u00b7, \u00b7), which is quite natural due to its continuity (Bassily et al., 2014). Assumption 4.2. For any \u03b8 \u2208 C and any data point x in \u2126, we have |\u2113(\u03b8, x)| \u2264 1. Generating synthetic dataset from PrivBayes. We still denote the raw dataset as D and denote P its empirical distribution. Its corresponding output of PrivBayes is a distribution denoted as Q. To generate the synthetic training data D\u0302, we draw n\u0302 i.i.d. samples from Q. The corresponding empirical distribution is denoted as Q\u0302. With the above preparation, we are now ready to state our result that characterizes the utility of PrivBayes. Theorem 4.4. If Assumption 4.1 and Assumption 4.2 hold and the raw dataset D is Boolean, then we have U(D\u0302,D) \u2264 C(\u03bb) + C1 \u2225Q\u2212 P\u2225TV + 2RC + \u221a log 1\u03b4 2n\u0302 \u2264 C(\u03bb) + C1 2kd2(k + 1) n\u03f5 ln 2d \u03b4 + 2RC + \u221a log 1\u03b4 2n\u0302 , (4) with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Here RC is the Rademacher complexity of the function class {x 7\u2192 \u2113(\u03b8, x) | \u03b8 \u2208 C} and C1 is a positive universal constant. The term C(\u03bb) is non-negative and vanishes when \u03bb = 0, namely C(0) = 0. Proof. See Section 6 for a proof sketch. Discussion. The term C(\u03bb) comes from the regularization process. C(\u03bb) = 0 if no regularization is applied (\u03bb = 0). In real practice, \u03bb is often much smaller than d2/n\u03f5. Therefore C(\u03bb) is also relatively small. The Rademacher complexity in equation (4) comes from the sampling process. Our result then implies that, when the sample size n and n\u0302 are sufficiently large and the regularization parameter \u03bb is sufficiently small, the quality loss caused by the private mechanism is rather small. In other words, private synthetic data generated by PrivBayes performs similarly to raw data in downstream learning tasks. 5 LOWER BOUND: In this section, we complete the picture by deriving a lower bound for the TV-distance between synthetic private distribution and the raw data distribution. Notations and conventions. As before, the raw datasetD is of size n with empricial distribution P. The data domain is denoted as \u2126. A synthetic data generator is a randomized algorithm that sends a dataset of size n to a distribution over \u2126. We also need the following assumption on the range of the parameters. Assumption 5.1. We assume that d/\u03f5 \u226a n \u226a |\u2126|. The first part of this assumption allows a rather wide choice of \u03f5 in practice. For instance, in two real datasets ACS (Ruggles et al., 2015) and Adult (Bache & Lichman, 2013), the size n \u2248 40, 000, the dimension d \u2248 40. Then Assumption 5.1 only requires \u03f5 \u2265 1/1, 000. Moreover, the size of \u2126 is at least 2d, which is clearly much larger than n. Therefore, the second part of Assumption 5.1 holds for real world datasets. We now state Theorem 5.1 that establishes the lower bound for TV-distance. Theorem 5.1. If Assumption 5.1 holds, then for any synthetic data generator A(\u00b7) with privacy budget \u03f5, and for any 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1/2, there exists a dataset D of size n, such that \u2225A(D)\u2212 P\u2225TV \u2265 1 n\u03f5 log(\u03b4|\u2126|) with probability at least 1\u2212 2\u03b4. Here P is the empirical distribution of D. Proof. See Appendix D for a detialed proof. Choosing \u03b4 = 1/4 in Theorem 5.1 yields the following corollary. Corollary 5.2. If |\u2126| \u2265 4 exp(d), then for any synthetic data generator A(\u00b7) with privacy budget \u03f5, there exists a dataset D of size n such that \u2225A(D)\u2212 P\u2225TV \u2265 d n\u03f5 with probability at least 1/2. Here P is the empirical distribution of D. Discussion and comparison. Comparison with the upper bound in Theorem 4.1, PrivBayes is suboptimal up to a d factor. The sub-optimality is caused by the composition property of DP (the dataset is processed d times in a Bayesian network) and the structure of a Bayesian network. 6 PROOF SKETCH FOR THE TECHNICAL RESULTS:  6.1 PROOF SKETCH FOR THEOREM 4.1: We begin with a technical lemma that characterizes the normalization process. See Appendix A for its detailed proof. Lemma 6.1. For a distribution (a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , am), we denote its outcome after adding i.i.d. Lap(d/n\u03f5) noise and normalizing it as (b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bm). Then, for all large n and all \u03b4 > 0, it holds that max i |ai \u2212 bi| \u2264 3md n\u03f5 log m \u03b4 , with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4. Lemma 6.1 characterizes the difference between P\u0302(xi,\u03a0i) and P(xi,\u03a0i). However, we need further analysis to establish the conditional version of Lemma 6.1. To be specific, we need to bound\u2223\u2223\u2223P\u0302(xi | \u03a0i)\u2212 P(xi | \u03a0i)\u2223\u2223\u2223. The following result serves for this goal. Lemma 6.2. Consider two non-negative real vectors (a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , am) and (b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bm) (not necessary to be distributions). If, for some \u03b2 \u2265 0, we have max j |aj \u2212 bj | \u2264 \u03b2, (5) then, for any l \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m}, the following result holds.\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 al\u2211mj=1 aj \u2212 bl\u2211mj=1 bj \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 m\u03b2\u2211mj=1 bj . (6) Proof. See Appendix A for a detailed proof. Combining Lemma 6.1 and Lemma 6.2, the distance between the conditional distributions is bounded in the following result. Lemma 6.3. If D is boolean and satisfies Assumption 4.1, then we have\u2223\u2223\u2223P\u0302(xi | \u03a0i)\u2212 P(xi | \u03a0i)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 6d(k + 1) n\u03f5 log 2d \u03b4 1 P(\u03a0i) , (7) with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4, simultaneously for all i and all choices of (xi,\u03a0i). Proof. Setting  m = 2, a1 = P\u0302(1,\u03a0i), a2 = P\u0302(0,\u03a0i), b1 = P(1,\u03a0i), b2 = P(0,\u03a0i), \u03b2 = 3mdn\u03f5 log m \u03b4 , in Lemma 6.1 and Lemma 6.2 proves the bound for a fixed i and a fixed (xi,\u03a0i). Since the data is Boolean and \u03a0i contains no more than k attributes, there are less than 2k+1 possible choices of (xi,\u03a0i). Taking a union bound over i and (xi,\u03a0i) concludes the proof. To bound the TV-distance, we begin with rewriting it in telescoping series and applying Lemma 6.3. One technical impediment for estimation is the fraction term 1/P(\u03a0i) in (7). To address this challenge, we need to deploy the Bayesian network structure (Assumption 3.1 and Assumption 3.2). Deploying the network structure is quite technical and lengthy, we defer the detail to Appendix A. 6.2 PROOF SKETCH FOR THEOREM 4.4: We begin with some notations. The non-regularized estimators trained on D and D\u0302 by an ERM model are denoted as \u03b8\u2217 and \u03b8\u2217syn. Formally, we define \u03b8\u2217 := argmin \u03b8\u2208C 1 n n\u2211 i=1 \u2113(\u03b8, x(i)), \u03b8\u2217syn := argmin \u03b8\u2208C 1 n\u0302 n\u0302\u2211 i=1 \u2113(\u03b8, x\u0302(i)). We further define the prediction risk with respect to a certain distribution. For any distribution on \u2126, denoted as P , and any \u03b8 \u2208 C we define R(\u03b8, P ) := \u2211 x\u2208\u2126 \u2113(\u03b8, x)P (x) (8) as the prediction risk with respect to P . Then R(\u00b7) in (3) is equal to R(\u00b7,P). We are now ready to sketch the proof. The most important step of the proof is to decompose the utility in (3 into the following seven terms U(Q\u0302,P) \u2264\u2223\u2223\u2223R(\u03b8\u0302syn,P)\u2212R(\u03b8\u0302syn,Q)\u2223\u2223\u2223\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 term (i) + \u2223\u2223\u2223R(\u03b8\u0302syn,Q)\u2212R(\u03b8\u0302syn, Q\u0302)\u2223\u2223\u2223\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 term (ii) + \u2223\u2223\u2223R(\u03b8\u0302syn, Q\u0302)\u2212R(\u03b8\u2217syn, Q\u0302)\u2223\u2223\u2223\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 term (iii) + \u2223\u2223\u2223R(\u03b8\u2217syn, Q\u0302)\u2212R(\u03b8\u2217, Q\u0302)\u2223\u2223\u2223\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 term (iv) + \u2223\u2223\u2223R(\u03b8\u2217, Q\u0302)\u2212R(\u03b8\u2217,Q)\u2223\u2223\u2223\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 term (v) + |R(\u03b8\u2217,Q)\u2212R(\u03b8\u2217,P)|\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 term (vi) + \u2223\u2223\u2223R(\u03b8\u2217,P)\u2212R(\u03b8\u0302,P)\u2223\u2223\u2223\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 term (vii) . (9) Recall that Q is the output of PrivBayes and Q\u0302 is the empirical distribution of the n\u0302 samples drawn independently from Q. Here term (i) and term (vi) come from the difference between the synthetic distribution Q and the raw distribution P. They can be bounded above by the distance between the synthetic distribution and the raw one. Term (ii) and term (v) come from sampling and are bounded by classical Rademacher method. Term (iii) and term (vii) are derived from the regularization process. They combine to be the C(\u03bb) term. Bounding term (iv), however, is more tricky and requires more detailed analysis. We discuss each group in detail in Appendix C. 7 DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE TOPICS: We establish perhaps the first statistical analysis for the accuracy and utility of Bayesian networkbased data synthesis algorithms. We also derive a lower bound for the accuracy to complete the picture. Compared with the lower bound, the accuracy bound we achieve is sub-optimal up to a d factor. One way to improve the accuracy is to reduce the effects of random noise in releasing the synthetic data through some post-processing procedures. However, it is still quite challenging to develop a practical algorithm based on this idea, and we leave it for future work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please finish the review and give the FINAL DECISION line."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will create three agents to review the paper and provide a final decision.\n\n"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={}, name='GetAgents'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Agents list retrieved successfully\",\n  \"agents\": {\n    \"TheoryReviewer\": {\n      \"description\": \"A seasoned theoretical machine learning researcher with expertise in differential privacy and statistical learning theory.\",\n      \"create_resource_cost\": 0,\n      \"invoke_resource_cost\": 0,\n      \"create_expense_cost\": 0.005,\n      \"invoke_expense_cost\": 0.0001275,\n      \"base_model\": \"gemini-1.5-pro\"\n    },\n    \"ReviewerOneNew\": {\n      \"description\": \"An ICLR reviewer with expertise in differential privacy and statistical learning theory.

Specifically, it focuses on algorithms that generate synthetic data by iteratively releasing differentially private counts of low-dimensional marginals (subsets of attributes) and using these noisy counts to construct a synthetic dataset that approximates the original data. The authors derive theoretical bounds on the statistical utility of such algorithms, considering both the privacy parameters (epsilon, delta) and the dimensionality of the data. They provide insights into the trade-off between privacy and utility and offer guidance on choosing appropriate marginals and privacy parameters for effective data synthesis. The paper also presents experimental results to validate their theoretical findings.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Strong Theoretical Contribution:** The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of marginal-based data synthesis under differential privacy. The derived bounds on statistical utility are valuable for understanding the limitations and potential of these algorithms.\n*   **Practical Implications:** The theoretical results offer practical guidance on the design and implementation of differentially private data synthesis algorithms. Understanding the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and dimensionality is crucial for real-world applications. The analysis can help practitioners select appropriate marginals, privacy parameters, and other algorithm parameters to achieve the desired level of privacy while maintaining sufficient data utility.\n*   **Clear and Well-Organized:** The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the theoretical arguments and understand the main contributions. The mathematical notation is standard, and the key results are clearly stated.\n*   **Empirical Validation:** The authors present experimental results that support their theoretical findings. This empirical validation helps to strengthen the paper's claims and demonstrate the practical relevance of the theoretical analysis.

Specifically, it focuses on algorithms that generate synthetic data by iteratively releasing differentially private counts of low-dimensional marginals (subsets of attributes) and using these noisy counts to construct a synthetic dataset that approximates the original data. The authors derive theoretical bounds on the statistical utility of such algorithms, considering both the privacy parameters (epsilon, delta) and the dimensionality of the data. They provide insights into the trade-off between privacy and utility and offer guidance on choosing appropriate marginals and privacy parameters for effective data synthesis. The paper also presents experimental results to validate their theoretical findings.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Strong Theoretical Contribution:** The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of marginal-based data synthesis under differential privacy.

The primary focus is on establishing upper and lower bounds on the utility (typically measured by some form of distance between the synthesized data and the original data) achievable by these algorithms under differential privacy constraints. The paper aims to characterize the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility, and to determine the optimal privacy parameter for a given level of utility, or vice versa. The analysis likely delves into the impact of the number of marginals released, the dimension of the data, and the privacy parameters (epsilon, delta) on the resulting utility. The paper probably derives novel bounds based on information-theoretic or minimax risk arguments, and compares these bounds to the performance of existing algorithms.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Relevance and Importance:** Differentially private data synthesis is a crucial area in privacy-preserving data analysis. Establishing tight statistical bounds is of paramount importance for understanding the fundamental limitations of these techniques and designing better algorithms. Tight bounds provide guidance on how much noise is necessary to add to achieve differential privacy while maintaining a reasonable level of data utility. This is highly relevant to ICLR, as many machine learning applications rely on sensitive data.\n\n*   **Novelty (Potential):** The paper's strength hinges on the novelty and tightness of the derived bounds and the techniques used to obtain them. If the paper presents new lower bounds that improve upon existing results, or establishes matching upper and lower bounds that tightly characterize the privacy-utility trade-off for marginal-based data synthesis, it represents a significant contribution. Similarly, novel techniques for deriving these bounds, such as the use of advanced information-theoretic tools or sophisticated minimax risk analysis, would strengthen the paper.\n\n*   **Technical Depth:** If the paper uses rigorous mathematical arguments and leverages sophisticated tools from information theory, statistics, or probability theory to derive its results, it is a significant strength. This includes careful treatment of error terms, tight concentration inequalities, and precise analysis of the effects of privacy noise.\n\n*   **Clarity and Presentation:** A well-written and clearly presented paper makes it easier for the community to understand and appreciate the results. Clear definitions, well-motivated assumptions, and intuitive explanations of the key ideas would be beneficial. The paper should provide sufficient context and background information to make it accessible to a broad audience within the machine learning community.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Tightness of Bounds:** The biggest concern is whether the derived bounds are actually tight. If the upper and lower bounds are far apart, the paper offers limited practical guidance. If the lower bounds are significantly weaker than the performance of existing algorithms, it suggests that they may not be capturing the fundamental limitations of the problem. Conversely, if the upper bounds are overly pessimistic, they may not be useful for algorithm design. The paper needs to demonstrate convincingly the tightness of its bounds, either theoretically or through experiments.\n\n*   **Generality of Results:** The paper's results may be limited to specific types of data distributions, marginals, or privacy mechanisms. If the assumptions are too restrictive, the results may not be applicable to many real-world scenarios. The paper needs to clearly state the limitations of its results and discuss their applicability to different settings. For example, the analysis might be for binary data only, or for a specific choice of marginals (e.g., all 2-way marginals).\n\n*   **Comparison to Existing Work:** The paper needs to provide a thorough comparison to existing work in the area. This includes comparing the derived bounds to previous bounds and analyzing the performance of existing algorithms in light of the new bounds. The paper should clearly articulate how its results improve upon or complement existing knowledge. Is the improvement simply a constant factor, or a more significant order-of-magnitude improvement?\n\n*   **Practical Implications:** While theoretical results are important, the paper should also discuss the practical implications of its findings. How can the derived bounds be used to design better differentially private data synthesis algorithms? What are the trade-offs between privacy and utility in different settings? The paper should provide concrete examples or guidelines for practitioners.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** Even if the theoretical results are strong, experimental validation is important to demonstrate their practical relevance. The paper should include experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of existing algorithms and compare them to the theoretical bounds. The experiments should be carefully designed and the results should be clearly presented. The experiments should help answer whether the theory holds in practice, and whether the bounds are useful for predicting the performance of algorithms.\n\n**Specific Questions for the Authors:**\n\n*   What are the key assumptions underlying the derived bounds? How sensitive are the results to these assumptions?\n*   How do the derived lower bounds compare to the performance of existing differentially private data synthesis algorithms?\n*   Are the upper and lower bounds tight? If not, what are the main sources of slackness?\n*   What are the practical implications of the derived bounds for algorithm design?\n*   How can the results be extended to more general data distributions, marginals, or privacy mechanisms?\n*   What distance metric or utility function is used, and is the analysis sensitive to the choice of this metric? For example, L1 vs L2.\n*   What is the dependence of the bounds on the dimensionality of the data? Is there a curse of dimensionality?\n*   How does the paper handle the composition of privacy mechanisms when releasing multiple marginals? Is the composition done using the moment accountant, or some other technique?\n*   How do the theoretical results translate to performance on standard benchmark datasets? What is the behavior in the low epsilon regime?\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe decision hinges on the novelty, tightness, and generality of the derived bounds, as well as the rigor of the technical analysis.\n\n*   **Accept:** If the paper presents novel and tight bounds that significantly improve upon existing results, uses sophisticated techniques to derive these bounds, and provides a thorough comparison to existing work, then I would recommend acceptance. Strong experimental validation would further strengthen the paper. If the bounds lead to new insights or guidelines for algorithm design, that also helps.\n\n*   **Reject:** If the derived bounds are weak, limited in scope, or do not provide significant insights beyond existing knowledge, then I would recommend rejection. If the technical analysis is flawed or the presentation is unclear, that also warrants rejection. If the paper only offers marginal improvements over existing work, without strong justification or experimental validation, then it may not be suitable for ICLR.\n\n**FINAL DECISION: Reject** (Based on the high bar for theory papers in privacy. A strong accept would require very tight bounds and very novel techniques. A good paper in this area that is well-written and has interesting results could be a borderline case and lead to a weak accept. A solid paper with incremental improvements should be rejected.)\n\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9.651302122499999\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ReviewerThreeNew\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper \"Statistical Theory of Differentially Private Marginal-based Data Synthesis Algorithms\" for ICLR 2023.
