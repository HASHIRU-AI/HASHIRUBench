The paper title is: A Time-Consistency Curriculum for Learning from Instance-Dependent Noisy Labels\n\nNone: Many machine learning algorithms are known to be fragile on simple instanceindependent noisy labels. However, noisy labels in real-world data are more devastating since they are produced by more complicated mechanisms in an instancedependent manner. In this paper, we target this practical challenge of InstanceDependent Noisy Labels by jointly training (1) a model reversely engineering the noise generating mechanism, which produces an instance-dependent mapping between the clean label posterior and the observed noisy label; and (2) a robust classifier that produces clean label posteriors. Compared to previous methods, the former model is novel and enables end-to-end learning of the latter directly from noisy labels. An extensive empirical study indicates that the time-consistency of data is critical to the success of training both models and motivates us to develop a curriculum selecting training data based on their dynamics on the two models\u2019 outputs over the course of training. We show that the curriculum-selected data provide both clean labels and high-quality input-output pairs for training the two models. Therefore, it leads to promising and robust classification performance even in notably challenging settings of instance-dependent noisy labels where many SoTA methods could easily fail. Extensive experimental comparisons and ablation studies further demonstrate the advantages and significance of the time-consistency curriculum in learning from instance-dependent noisy labels on multiple benchmark datasets. 1 INTRODUCTION: The training of neural networks can easily fail in the presence of even the simple instance-independent noisy labels since they quickly lead to model overfitting of the noises (Zhang et al., 2017). In practice, however, it is usually challenging to control the labeling quality of large-scale datasets because the labels were generated by complicated mechanisms such as non-expert workers (Han et al., 2020b). An average of 3.3% noisy labels is identified in the test/validation sets of 10 of the most commonly-used datasets in computer vision, natural language, and audio analysis (Northcutt et al., 2021). Moreover, real-world noisy labels are generated in an instance-dependent manner, which is significantly more challenging to address than the most widely studied but oversimplified instance-independent noises, which assume that the noise only depends on the class (Wei et al., 2022). Two principal methodologies have been developed to address the label noises: (1) detecting samples (X, Y\u0303 ) with correct labels Y\u0303 = Y (empirically, they are the ones with the smallest loss values) and using them to train a clean classifier (Han et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2019); (2) learning the noise generating mechanism, i.e., a transition matrix T defining the mapping between clean label Y and noisy label Y\u0303 such that P (Y\u0303 | X) = T\u22a4P (Y | X), where P (\u00b7 | X) denotes the posterior vector, and then using it to build statistically consistent classifiers (Liu & Tao, 2016; Patrini et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021). Although both methodologies have achieved promising results in the simplified instanceindependent (class-dependent) setting, they have non-trivial drawbacks when applied to the more practical but complicated instance-dependent noises: (1) the \u201csmall loss\u201d trick is no longer effective in detecting correct labels (Cheng et al., 2021) because the loss threshold drastically varies across instances and is determined by each transition matrix T (X); (2) the instance-dependent transition matrix T (X) is not identifiable given only the noisy sample and it heavily relies on the estimation of clean label Y in the triple (X,Y, Y\u0303 ) (Yang et al., 2021), which is an unsolved challenge in (1). Therefore, the two learning problems are entangled, i.e., the training of a clean label predictor and the transition matrix estimator depends on each other\u2019s accuracy, which substantially relies on the quality of training data (X,Y, Y\u0303 ). Specifically, the \u201csmall loss\u201d trick cannot provide a high-quality estimation of Y due to the instance-specific threshold of loss. Moreover, the estimation of Y can change rapidly due to the non-stationary loss, which can fluctuate during training and provide inconsistent training signals over time for both models if selected for training. Furthermore, the data subset selection inevitably introduces biases toward easy-to-fit samples and degrades the data diversity (Yang et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2021; Berthon et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2020), which in fact is critical to the training and the accuracy of both models, especially the transition matrix estimator, because easy-to-fit samples usually have extremely sparse transition matrices. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel metric \u201cTime-Consistency of Prediction (TCP)\u201d to select high-quality data to train both models. TCP measures the consistency of model prediction for an instance over the course of training, which reflects whether its given label results in gradients consistent with the majority of other instances, and this criterion turns out to be a more reliable identifier of clean labels. When applied to the training of clean label predictor, TCP is more accurate in clean label detection than \u201csmall loss\u201d (or high confidence) criterion, because it avoids the comparison of confidence for samples with instance-dependent loss/confidence thresholds. Moreover, when applied to the training of the transition matrix estimator, TCP measures the time-consistency of predicted noisy labels Y\u0303 . Surprisingly, it also faithfully reflects the correctness of the predicted clean label Y . Since the objective to estimate the transition matrix is defined by both Y and Y\u0303 , selecting samples with high TCP considerably improves the training of the transition matrix estimator. In addition, to exploit the data diversity in training the two models, we apply a curriculum that starts from selecting only a few high TCP data for early-stage training but progressively includes more training data once the two models become maturer and more consistent. In this paper, we develop a three-stage training strategy with the TCP curriculum embedded. In every training step, we first update the clean label predictor using selected data with high TCP on this model, followed by training the transition matrix estimator given the predicted clean label posterior and the noisy labels on selected data with high TCP on the estimator, and end with fine-tuning the clean label predictor directly using the noisy label and the estimated transition matrix. It is worth noting that the TCP metrics for the two models are updated using the model outputs collected from this dynamic training process without causing additional cost. As demonstrated by extensive empirical studies and experimental comparisons, our method leads to efficient joint training of the two models that mutually benefits from each other and produces an accurate estimation of both the clean label and instance-dependent transition matrix. On multiple benchmark datasets with either synthetic or real-world noises, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements. 2 BACKGROUNDS AND RELATED WORKS: Let (X,Y ) \u2208 X \u00d7 {1, . . . , c} be the random variables for instances and clean labels, where X represents the instance space and c is the number of classes. In many real-world applications, the observed labels are not always correct but contain some noise. Let Y\u0303 be the random variable for the noisy label. What we have is a sample {(x1, y\u03031), . . . , (xn, y\u0303n)} drawn from the noisy distribution D\u03c1 of the random variables (X, Y\u0303 ). We aim to learn a robust classifier that could assign clean labels to test data by exploiting the sample with noisy labels. Label noise models. Currently, there are three typical label noise models, which are the random classification noise (RCN) model (Biggio et al., 2011; Natarajan et al., 2013; Manwani & Sastry, 2013), the class-dependent label noise (CDN) model (Patrini et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2019; Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018), and the instance-dependent label noise (IDN) model (Berthon et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2021). Specifically, RCN assumes that clean labels flip randomly with a constant rate; CDN assumes that the flip rate only depends on the true class; IDN considers the most general case of label noise, where the flip rate depends on its instance. Since IDN is non-identifiable without any additional assumption, some simplified variants were proposed. (Xia et al., 2020b) proposed the part-dependent label noise (PDN) model which assumes that the label noise depends on parts of instances. (Cheng et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021) assume that the flip rates are dependent on instances but can be upper bounded by a value smaller than 1. This paper focuses on the original IDN model without introducing any additional assumptions. Estimating the transition matrix. The structure of label noise is usually formulated by a c \u00d7 c transition matrix T , where c is the number of classes and its ij-th element Tij(x) = P (Y\u0303 = j | Y = i,X = x), which represents the probability that the instance x with the clean label Y = i actually has a noisy label Y\u0303 = j. The transition matrix naturally establishes the connection between noisy posterior and clean posterior, i.e., P (Y\u0303 | X) = T\u22a4(X)P (Y | X), and thus plays an important role in building statistically consistent classifiers in label-noise learning (Liu & Tao, 2016; Scott, 2015). To estimate it, a cross-validation method can be applied for the binary classification task (Natarajan et al., 2013). For CDN, the transition matrix could be learned by exploiting anchor points (Patrini et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018). For IDN, the transition matrix for an instance could be approximated by a combination of the transition matrices for the parts of the instance (Xia et al., 2020b) or a Bayes label transition matrix (Yang et al., 2021). Yao et al. (2021) exploited the causal graph to estimate the transition relations between clean and noisy labels. Curriculum learning. Curriculum learning was first proposed by Bengio et al. (2009), which describes a learning paradigm in which a model is learned by gradually introducing samples of increasing hardness to training. Its effectiveness has been empirically verified in a wide range of applications, e.g., computer vision (Chen & Gupta, 2015), natural language processing (Turian et al., 2010), and multitask learning (Graves et al., 2017). Curriculum for label-noise learning has been also investigated. MentorNet (Jiang et al., 2018) pre-trains an extra network producing a data-driven curriculum selecting data instances to guide the training. When the clean validation data is not available, MentorNet has to use a predefined curriculum. RoCL (Zhou et al., 2021) develops a curriculum learning strategy that smoothly transitions between (1) detection and supervised training on clean data; and (2) relabeling and self-supervision on noisy data. Nevertheless, RoCL has no convergence guarantee and needs extra data augmentations to collect spatial-consistent pseudo labels. Moreover, existing methods for learning with noisy labels employ heuristics to reduce the side-effect of noisy labels, e.g., selecting reliable samples (Han et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020a), reweighting samples (Ren et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018; Kremer et al., 2018; Reed et al., 2015), correcting labels Tanaka et al. (2018); Zheng et al. (2020), designing robust loss functions Zhang & Sabuncu (2018); Xu et al. (2019); Liu & Guo (2020); Ma et al. (2020), employing side information (Vahdat, 2017; Li et al., 2017), and (implicitly) adding regularization (Li et al., 2021; 2017; Veit et al., 2017; Vahdat, 2017; Han et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Han et al., 2020a). 3 EXAMPLES SELECTION CRITERION: TIME-CONSISTENCY OF PREDICTION: According to the observation that the loss on instances with clean labels is usually smaller than instances with noisy labels, the loss computed at an instantaneous step has been widely adopted as a selection criterion for confident examples (Han et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). It is because instances with clean labels are mutually consistent with each other in producing gradient updates, allowing the model to fit them better and thereby make the loss smaller than instances with noisy labels. Unfortunately, the instantaneous loss was found only work well on the instance-independent label noise (Cheng et al., 2021). For a deep neural network, because of the non-smooth nature of the loss and the randomness of stochastic gradient descent, the instantaneous loss of each instance can change dramatically between consecutive epochs, leading to a huge gap between training sets selected over consecutive epochs. Therefore, it is necessary to take the training history of each instance into consideration. Zhou et al. (2020) proposed a robust version of the instantaneous loss as the exponential moving average of it over the course of training. Nevertheless, in the IDN case, each instance with its noisy label is a unique pattern, which is more complex and thereby requires a more robust selection criterion. Apparently, at the instance level, the one-hot prediction of an instance is a more robust metric than the loss because the former has a tolerance to the change of predicted class posterior while the latter has not, i.e., the one-hot prediction remains unchanged if the position of the max element in the predicted class posterior vector is maintained but the cross-entropy loss changes once the predicted class posterior changes. Inspired by the above insights, we propose a time-consistency of prediction (TCP) metric as follows: TCPt+1(x) = t t+ 1 TCPt(x) + 1 t+ 1 InPt+1(x), where InPt+1(x) = 1[y\u0302t+1 = y\u0302t]. (1) This metric considers the prediction consistency over the course of training, which can better describe the IDN data and select confident examples than the previous ones. To see this, we first manually add IDN at 0.4 noise rate (IDN-0.4) onto a benchmark dataset CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and train a ResNet34 (He et al., 2016) for 100 epochs with a constant learning rate. Since no curriculum strategy is applied here, we select confident examples at every epoch t with a fixed number 5,000 according to four types of selection criterion, i.e., instantaneous prediction InPt(x), instantaneous loss \u2113(x), time-consistency of prediction TCPt(x), and time-consistency of loss (defined in the same way as TCP). Then we count the number of instances with clean labels from the selected confident examples and calculate the clean ratios (ratio of clean instances to selected instances). As shown in Figure 2, we can find that the two instantaneous metrics have clean ratios lower than 0.6, which are worse than random selection. As for time-consistency of loss, the clean ratio is slightly higher than the random selection. Those three metrics are basically not discriminative to the noisy data. By contrast, the proposed TCP metric has a distinguishable performance, uplifting more than 20 percent of the clean ratio of the selected confident examples. More empirical study regarding Figures 1 and 2 is provided in Appendix A. Moreover, we partition the whole data into three groups (high TCP (10%), middle TCP (80%), and low TCP (10%)) by the TCP calculated at the start stage (epoch 5), early stage (epoch 30), and end stage (epoch 95). We visualize the mean and variance of the groups through the whole training epochs. As shown in Figure 1, the startstage partition fails at the end stage as three groups are entangled together while the earlystage partition shares the almost same pattern as the end-stage partition. Thus, we can conclude that the early-stage TCP is reflective of the property of each instance in the future, which means the time-consistent examples selected in the early stage will not mislead the classifier because their TCP are still high and thus they will still be selected as time-consistent examples in the rest training epochs. Besides, a warmup for the TCP is proved to be necessary. 4 TCP GUIDED CURRICULUM LEARNING FOR INSTANCE-DEPENDENT NOISY LABELS: Our curriculum contains two sub-curriculum corresponding to two main challenges for solving the IDN problem: (1) detecting examples with clean labels; (2) learning the transition matrix. In this section, we elaborate on how to use TCP to design curricula to achieve these goals. Below we use clean- and noisy-TCP to refer to time consistency of clean label predictions (argmax P\u0302 (y | x)) and noisy label predictions (argmax P\u0302 (y\u0303 | x)) over historical training steps, respectively. 4.1 LEARNING A PRIMARY CLEAN CLASSIFIER WITH HIGH CLEAN-TCP INSTANCES: In Section 3, we demonstrate that clean-TCP can be used to select examples with clean labels because they are mutually consistent with each other in producing gradient updates and easy to be learned to have high clean-TCP. However, as shown in Figure 2, not all of the selected high clean-TCP instances have clean labels. The reason why those instances have high clean-TCP but not clean labels is because they are far away from the classification boundary and inherently hard to be misclassified even though their given labels are wrong. Namely, their labels get corrected by the classifier, and high clean-TCP indicates the pseudo labels assigned by the classifier are correct. Therefore, with clean-TCP, we design a curriculum which exploits both examples with clean labels and instances with correct pseudo labels to learn a clean classifier. We theoretically prove that introducing high clean-TCP instance with its pseudo label does not cause catastrophic forgetting of the learned confident examples. Consider the situation we have a labeled set L (in practice it can be the selected confident examples set) and one unlabeled instance x\u2032. By training on L for one step, we have \u03b8t+1 = \u03b8t + \u03b7 \u2211 x\u2208L \u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x; \u03b8t); and by training on L and x\u2032 for one step, we have \u03b8 \u2032 t+1 = \u03b8t + \u03b7 (\u2211 x\u2208L \u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x; \u03b8t) +\u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x\u2032; \u03b8t) ) , where \u03b8t denotes the network parameters at step t and \u03b7 denotes the learning rate. Then we have 1 \u03b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2211 x\u2208L [ \u2113 (x; \u03b8t+1)\u2212 \u2113 ( x; \u03b8 \u2032 t+1 )]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223p y\u0302\u2032t t+1(x \u2032) p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032) \u2212 1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (2) where py\u0302 \u2032 t t (x \u2032) is the probability of x\u2032 belonging to y\u0302\u2032t at step t, and y\u0302 \u2032 t is the prediction (pseudo label) of x\u2032 at step t. The detailed derivation is provided in Appendix B. If x\u2032 is selected with high clean-TCP, py\u0302 \u2032 t t (x \u2032) is very close to p y\u0302\u2032t t+1(x \u2032) because it has been verified in Figure 1 that instances with high clean-TCP in the early stage maintain their high clean-TCP in the future, which means the loss change can be bounded with a very small value. Therefore, exploiting high clean-TCP instances with pseudo labels helps to correct corrupted labels and learn a clean classifier without causing catastrophic forgetting of the learned examples with correct labels. In Figure 3, we show the clean ratios of the original noisy labels and pseudo labels of instances selected with our curriculum during the whole training process. The clean ratio for pseudo labels maintains an amazing high value, much better than the original clean ratio. Therefore, the clean classifier can be learned by minimizing \u2211N n=1 L (f(xn), y\u2217n), where y\u2217 can be the original noisy label or pseudo label in different learning phases. Implementation details can be found in Section 4.3. 4.2 LEARNING A TRANSITION MATRIX WITH HIGH NOISY-TCP INSTANCES: The transition matrix is not identifiable by only exploiting noisy data without introducing additional assumptions, therefore we formulate the objective function for leaning the transition matrix based on the equation P (Y\u0303 | X) = T\u22a4(X)P (Y | X) as follow: min T 1 N N\u2211 n=1 L ( T\u22a4(xn)f(xn), y\u0303n ) , where f(xn) = P\u0302 (y | xn) . (3) To select the high-quality triplets (X,Y, Y\u0303 ) for the above objective, two conditions should be considered. First, it is necessary for f(\u00b7) to output a precise clean class posterior, otherwise, T cannot be optimized in the correct direction, in the case y\u0303 is given and f(\u00b7) has been learned in advance and is fixed. As we discussed above, instances with high clean-TCP tend to have the correct pseudo label, and thereby a precise clean class posterior, which satisfies this necessary condition. Second, the noisy-TCP should be high. By treating T\u22a4(x)f(x) as a whole predictor for y\u0303, the corresponding new objective is to predict y\u0303. Therefore, high noisy-TCP instances naturally indicate the instance is learned better and faster for predicting y\u0303, leading to stable and fast learning. We discover that the noisy-TCP inherently has a strong correlation with clean-TCP so we can use it to select triplets fulfilling both conditions above. To see this, at each epoch, we calculate the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient1 between the noisy-TCP and clean-TCP of the whole dataset. Besides, we calculate the clean ratio of the selected high noisy-TCP instances w.r.t. their pseudo labels. In Figure 5, we show the data distribution in terms of clean- and noisyTCP at epoch 50 (More data distributions at different epochs are provided in Appendix C). The green regression line partially implies the linear correlation between the clean- and noisy-TCP. Also, instances with correct pseudo labels are mainly distributed in the high TCP area, and vice versa. As shown in 4, the Spearman rankorder correlation coefficient is above 0.6 after 10 epochs with a consistent 0 p-value, roughly indicating that noisy-TCP is strongly Spearman rank-order correlated with clean-TCP for 100% sure. Meanwhile, the clean ratio is consistently above 0.8, which means those high noisy-TCP instances also have correct clean predictions and thereby probably precise clean class posterior. Note that the clean ratio decreases at the late stage because the curriculum selects almost all the data at the end. Overall, high noisy-TCP instances not only are naturally stable for the new objective to predict y\u0303 but also satisfy the necessary condition to have precise clean class posterior, which make them perfect examples for learning the transition matrix. 4.3 TCP GUIDED CURRICULUM LEARNING ALGORITHM: The main steps of our algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 1 with the complete procedure detailed in Appendix D. First, we warm up the feature extractor \u03d5, classification layer c by minimizing a standard cross-entropy (CE) loss on noisy data, and meanwhile compute the clean-TCP for every instance. Then, we warm up the transition matrix layer t with high clean-TCP instances and obtain the noisy-TCP for every instance. From now on, iteratively, high clean-TCP instances are fed to the clean classifier (green part in Figure 6) to train a primary clean classifier with the clean CE loss, and based on the primary clean classifier, instances with high noisy-TCP are fed to the transition matrix (blue part in Figure 6) to train a transition matrix with the noisy CE loss while the parameters of 1The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of the monotonicity of the relationship between two sets (Zar, 2005). Algorithm 1 TCP Guided Curriculum Learning Algorithm. Input: Noisy training sample D, feature extractor \u03d5, classification layer c, transition matrix layer t, f(\u00b7) = c(\u03d5(\u00b7)), T (\u00b7) = t(\u03d5(\u00b7)), number sequences Nc and Nt, training epoch e. 1: Warmup clean- and noisy- TCP 2: Curriculum training: 3: for e in {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , e} do 4: Select Nt[e] high noisy-TCP instances as Dt. 5: Train t while fixing \u03d5 and c on Dt by minimizing \u2211N n=1 Ln ( T\u22a4(xn)f(xn), y\u0303n ) . 6: Select Nc[e] high clean-TCP instances as Dc. 7: Train \u03d5 and c on Dc by minimizing \u2211N n=1 Lc (f(xn), y\u2217n), where y\u2217 is the pseudo label. 8: Fix t and fine-tune \u03d5 and c on D by minimizing \u2211N n=1 Ln ( T\u22a4(xn)f(xn), y\u0303n ) . 9: Record the clean and noisy prediction and calculate the clean- and noisy-TCP by Eq. equation 1. 10: end for Output: Optimized feature extractor \u03d5, classification layer c, transition matrix layer t. the primary clean classifier are frozen. Then the clean classifier gets improved by being fine-tuned on the whole data with the fixed transition matrix. The clean- and noisy-TCP of every instance are updated at the end of each epoch. Finally, a transition matrix with a small estimation error and a clean classifier with a performance improvement can be obtained. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we examine how the proposed methods learn a robust classifier against instancedependent noisy labels. Dataset. We employ three widely used datasets, i.e., F-MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), and CIFAR10/100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), and four versions of the real-world noisy dataset CIFAR10N (Wei et al., 2022), and Clothing1M (Xiao et al., 2015). F-MNIST contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images with 10 classes. SVHN and CIFAR10 both have 10 classes of images, but the former contains 73,257 training images and 26,032 test images, and the latter contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images while CIFAR100 has 100 classes. CIFAR10N provides CIFAR10 images with human-annotated noisy labels obtained from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Four versions of CIFAR10N label sets are employed here, three of which are labeled by three independent workers (named CIFAR10N-1/2/3) and one of which is negatively aggregated from the above three sets (named CIFAR10N-W). Clothing1M has 1M images with real-world noisy labels and additional 50k, 14k, 10k images with clean labels for training, validation and test, and we only use noisy training set in the training phase. For all the datasets, we leave out 10% of the training data as a validation set, which is for model selection. The final test model is selected with the highest validation accuracy. Noisy labels generation. For clean datasets, we artificially corrupt the class labels of training and validation sets following the instance-dependent noisy labels generalization method in Xia et al. (2020b). We generate noisy datasets of {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} five noise rates. Baselines and measurements. On synthetic noisy datasets, without introducing data augmentation techniques and semi-supervised learning, we compare the proposed method TCP with the following baselines: (i). CE, which optimizes the standard cross-entropy loss on noisy datasets. (ii). Decoupling (Malach & Shalev-Shwartz, 2017), which trains two networks on samples whose predictions are different. (iii). MentorNet Jiang et al. (2018), Co-teaching (Han et al., 2018b), and Co-teaching+ (Yu et al., 2019), that mainly handle noisy labels by training on instances with small loss. (iv). Joint (Tanaka et al., 2018), which jointly optimizes labels and network parameters. (v). DMI (Xu et al., 2019), which uses a novel information-theoretic loss function to learn a robust classifier. (vi). Forward (Patrini et al., 2017), Reweight (Liu & Tao, 2016), and T-Revision (Xia et al., 2019), that utilize a class-dependent transition matrix T to correct the loss function. (vii). PTD (Xia et al., 2020b) and Bayes (Yang et al., 2021), estimate instance-dependent transition matrix under some additional assumptions; CRUST (Mirzasoleiman et al., 2020) iteratively selects subsets of clean data points that provide an approximately low-rank Jacobian matrix; CausalINL (Yao et al., 2021) exploits the causal graph to estimate the transition relations between clean and noisy labels. On real-world noisy datasets, we apply the transition matrix learning and fine-tuning parts to the SoTA method Dividemix (Li et al., 2020), i.e., at each epoch, in addition to the Dividemix training, we select high noisy-TCP data to learn the transition matrix and use it to fine-tune the whole data. Then we compare this combined method TCP-D with the following SoTA methods: (i). PES (Bai et al., 2021). (ii). Dividemix (Li et al., 2020). (iii). CORES (Cheng et al., 2021). (iv). ELR+ (Liu et al., 2020). (v). JoCoR (Wei et al., 2020b). (vi). CAL (Zhu et al., 2021). We use a ResNet18 network for F-MNIST, a ResNet34 network for SVHN and CIFAR10, a ResNet50 network for CIFAR100, a PreAct-ResNet18 for CIFAR10N, and a pre-trained ResNet50 network for Clothing1M. More training details are provided in Appendix E. Classification accuracy is employed to evaluate the performance of each model on the clean test set. Results over 5 trials on all datasets except Clothing1M, for which the result is over 1 trial, are reported. Comparison with the State-of-the-Arts. We compare TCP with multiple baselines using the same network architecture. Table 1 show the results on CIFAR10 with different rates of IDN from 0.1 to 0.5, respectively. TCP outperforms baselines across all datasets and noise rates. The improvement is significant when the noise rate is large. Tables 5, 6, and 7 show the results on F-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR100, which are provided in Appendix F. Table 2 show the results on real-world noisy datasets CIFAR10N-1/2/3/W and Clothing1M. TCP-D consistently achieves the best test accuracy on real-world noisy datasets. Note that the results of baselines on CIFAR10N are taken from the official leaderboard http://www.noisylabels.com/. Comparison on the transition matrix estimation error. We compare the transition matrix estimation error of our method with the instance-independent method Forward (Patrini et al., 2017), and two Table 2: Means and stds of classification accuracy on real-world noisy datasets.

As shown in Figure 7, our method achieves the consistent best estimation error on CIFAR10 with different noise rates. Ablation study. We study the effect of removing different components of our methods to provide insights into what makes TCP successful in Table 3. TCP w/o Dc indicates that we do not select high clean-TCP data Dc to learn the clean classifier while TCP w/o Dt indicates that we do not select high noisy-TCP data Dt to learn the transition matrix and use it to fine-tune the clean classifier. Results show that the performances of both reduced methods decrease. Without Dc, the primary clean classifier cannot be learned, and thus the transition matrix cannot be learned well. Without Dt, the transition matrix is not learned, and thus the whole noisy data cannot be fully exploited to build the consistent classifier. To sum up, the learning of the clean classifier and the transition matrix benefit and boost each other. 6 CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we study the instance-dependent label noise (IDN) problem, which is a more general and practical setting than the previously addressed instance-independent label noise problem. Targeting the main challenges, we propose a novel time-consistency metric, i.e., TCP for the IDN problem. Based on TCP, we can detect examples with clean labels or correct pseudo labels better than the existing measures, and allocate reliable triplets for learning the transition matrix. Then we design an assumption-free curriculum that learns the clean classifier, as well as the transition matrix simultaneously. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method remarkably surpasses the baselines on many datasets with both synthetic noise and real-world noise, and achieves the smallest transition matrix estimation error than existing methods. A MORE EMPIRICAL STUDY REGARDING FIGURES 1 AND 2: A.1 MORE EMPIRICAL STUDY REGARDING FIGURE. 1 Figures 8 and 9 show the results on more practical dataset CIFAR100 and IDN noise 0.4 higher IDN noise 0.6 with different partitions (2:6:2), which demonstrate that our claims hold in general and do not change sensitively with the partition ratios. Figures 10 and 11 show the results on datasets CIFAR100 and SVHN with different model architectures. Conclusions from Section 3 are based on the memorization effect of overparameterized DNNs. Therefore, they hold better for deeper DNNs (ResNet50) than the shallower DNNs (AlexNet). Moreover, for AlexNet on SVHN, the high TCP group partitioned at an early stage has no overlap with the middle TCP group. Overall, the results demonstrate that our conclusions in the paper holds true and generalize to other architectures and datasets. A.2 COMPARISON WITH SOTA SELECTION METHODS Following the same setting as Figure 2, we select 5,000 confident examples at every epoch t according to six types of selection criterion, i.e., instantaneous prediction InPt(x), instantaneous loss \u2113(x), time-consistency of prediction TCPt(x), time-consistency of loss, and two SOTA confident sample selection methods: FINE (Kim et al., 2021) and Topological Filter (Wu et al., 2020). Then we count the number of instances with clean labels and calculate the clean ratios. As shown in Figure 12, at the starting stage, when the model just learns the clean data while has not fit the noisy data, FINE and Topological Filter perform perform well. As the training goes and the model fits the noisy data, our method achieves the best selection clean ratio . B THEORETICAL ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECT OF INTRODUCING INSTANCES WITH PSEUDO LABELS: Consider the situation we have a labeled set L (in practice it can be the selected confident examples set) and one unlabeled instance x\u2032. By training on L for one step, we have \u03b8t+1 = \u03b8t + \u03b7 \u2211 x\u2208L \u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x; \u03b8t) , and by training on L and x\u2032 for one step, we have \u03b8 \u2032 t+1 = \u03b8t + \u03b7 (\u2211 x\u2208L \u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x; \u03b8t) +\u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x\u2032; \u03b8t) ) , where \u03b8t denotes the network parameters at step t and \u03b7 denotes the learning rate. The Taylor expansion of loss \u2113 (x; \u03b8) at the point \u03b8 = \u03b80 is: g\u03b80 (\u03b8) = [\u2211 x\u2208L \u2113 (x; \u03b80) +\u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x; \u03b80) (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80) ] + o ( (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80)2 ) . (4) Then we evaluate the forgetting effect of introducing instances x\u2032 with its pseudo label to the training set by checking the change of loss over the labeled set L with x\u2032 added or not. If adding x\u2032 does not cause a vital change, we can conclude that it does not lead to catastrophic forgetting of the learned examples with correct labels. Therefore, we calculate the change of loss over the labeled set by 1 \u03b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2211 x\u2208L [ \u2113 ( x; \u03b8t+1 ) \u2212 \u2113 ( x; \u03b8\u0302t+1 )]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 1\u03b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223g\u03b8t (\u03b8t+1)\u2212 g\u03b8t (\u03b8\u0302t+1)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2248 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2207\u03b8\u2113 (x\u2032; \u03b8t)\u2211 x\u2208L \u2207\u03b8\u2113 ( x; \u03b8t )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202\u2113 (x\u2032; \u03b8t)\u2202\u03b8t \u2202\u03b8t\u2202t \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202\u2113 (x\u2032; \u03b8t)\u2202t \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202\u2113 (x\u2032; \u03b8t)\u2202py\u0302\u2032tt (x\u2032) \u2202p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032) \u2202t \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , where py\u0302 \u2032 t t (x \u2032) is the probability of x\u2032 belonging to y\u0302\u2032t at step t, and y\u0302 \u2032 t is the prediction (pseudo label) of x\u2032 at step t. The second line holds because we omit the second and higher order terms of the Taylor expansion in Eq equation 4. Then, with cross-entropy loss employed, we have \u2202\u2113 (x\u2032; \u03b8t) \u2202p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032) = \u2202 log(p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032)) \u2202p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032) = \u2212 1 p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032) . Next, by using ( p y\u0302\u2032t t+1(x \u2032)\u2212 py\u0302 \u2032 t t (x \u2032) ) to approximate \u2202p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032) \u2202t , we have 1 \u03b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2211 x\u2208L [ \u2113 (x; \u03b8t+1)\u2212 \u2113 ( x; \u03b8 \u2032 t+1 )]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2248 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223p y\u0302\u2032t t+1(x \u2032) p y\u0302\u2032t t (x \u2032) \u2212 1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (5) Since x\u2032 is selected with high clean-TCP, py\u0302 \u2032 t t (x \u2032) is very close to py\u0302 \u2032 t t+1(x \u2032) because it has been verified in Figure 1 that instances with high clean-TCP in the early stage maintain their high clean-TCP in the future, which means the loss change can be bounded with a very small value. Therefore, exploiting high clean-TCP instances with pseudo labels helps to correct corrupted labels and learn a clean classifier without causing catastrophic forgetting of the learned examples with correct labels. C DATA DISTRIBUTION IN TERMS OF CLEAN- AND NOISY-TCP AT DIFFERENT TRAINING STAGES:  D ALGORITHM:  E TRAINING DETAILS: We use a ResNet18 network for F-MNIST, a ResNet34 network for SVHN and CIFAR10, a ResNet50 network for CIFAR100, a PreAct-ResNet18 for CIFAR10N, and a pre-trained ResNet50 network for Clothing1M. The transition matrix is modeled by a linear layer which transforms the latent representation vector to a c2 vector, and then reshaped to a c\u00d7 c matrix. The batchsize is set to 32 for Clothing1M and 128 for others. The weight decay is set to 1e\u22124, 5e\u22124, 0, 5e\u22124, and 0.001 for F-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10/100, CIFAR10N, and Clothing1M, respectively. For synthetic noisy datasets, we use the Adam optimizer. At the warmup clean-TCP stage, the learning rate is initialized Algorithm 2 TCP Guided Curriculum Learning Algorithm.

In the rest of 100-epoch training, the leaning rate of the feature extractor \u03d5 and classification layer c is 1e\u22124 and divided by 10 at epoch 30 and 80; the leaning rate of the transition matrix layer t is 3e\u22124 before epoch 30 and 1e\u22125 otherwise. The learning rate for fine-tuning is 1e\u22126. For real-world noisy dataset CIFAR10N and Clothing1M, we follow the optimization method as Dividemix. For CIFAR10N, in the warmup clean-TCP stage, the learning rate is initialized to 0.001 and decayed every 5 epochs with 50 epochs in total by a factor of 1/3. In the rest of 300-epoch training, the leaning rate of the transition matrix layer t is 6e\u22123 before epoch 80 and 2e\u22124 between epoch 80 and 150, and 2e\u22124 otherwise. The learning rate for fine-tuning is 2e\u22123 before epoch 80, and 6e\u22124 between epoch 80 and 150, and 2e\u22124 between epoch 150 and 250, and 2e\u22125 otherwise. For Clothing1M, in the warmup clean-TCP stage, the learning rate is initialized to 0.002 and decayed every 2 epochs with 5 epochs in total by a factor of 1/3. In the rest of 20-epoch training, the leaning rate of the transition matrix layer t is 6e\u22124 before epoch 8 and 2e\u22125 between epoch 8 and 12, and 5e\u22126 otherwise. The learning rate for fine-tuning is 2e\u22124 before epoch 10, and 6e\u22125 between epoch 10 and 14, and 2e\u22125 between epoch 14 and 17, and 2e\u22126 otherwise. E.1 TRAINING TIME Due to the light-weight and simple network architecture, our method is more time-efficient and scalable than those methods, which employs dual networks or requires data augmentations for semi-supervised learning. We report the time costs below to demonstrate this advantage. The additional cost caused by estimating T and fine-tune is small. For each epoch, the additional time cost of estimating-T part is neglectable when compared with the cost of one standard training epoch minimizing the cross-entropy loss. This is because estimating T only updates the parameters of a c\u00d7 c linear layer, where c is the number of classes. The time cost of fine-tune part is slightly bigger than one standard training epoch. Fortunately, both parts are not necessary to be applied in every epoch. In our experiments, we only apply them at the last 50 epochs. Moreover, since traning clean classifier part (line 7 in Algorithm 1) and estimating T part only involves the high clean-TCP and high noisy-TCP data rather than the whole data, which save plenty of time for the fine-tune part. Therefore, in practice, our method can easily adapt and scale to meet the realistic settings.

The core idea is to exploit the intuition that even with noisy labels, an instance's true label is more likely to be *temporally consistent*.  The method likely involves tracking model predictions for each instance across multiple training epochs and uses the agreement or disagreement across these predictions to construct a curriculum.  Instances with consistently predicted labels (high time-consistency) are considered \"cleaner\" and are used to train the model in earlier stages of the curriculum.  Instances with inconsistent predictions (low time-consistency) are introduced later, potentially with some re-labeling or down-weighting mechanism.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Addresses an Important Problem:** Learning with noisy labels is a significant challenge in real-world machine learning applications. Instance-dependent noise, where the probability of a label being incorrect depends on the specific instance, is a particularly difficult form of noise. This paper directly tackles this issue.\n*   **Intuitive and Potentially Effective Approach:** The idea of using time-consistency as a proxy for label quality is intuitive and makes sense.  It leverages the inherent redundancy in data and model learning to filter out noisy labels.\n*   **Curriculum Learning Framework:** Framing the problem within a curriculum learning framework is a well-established and promising approach for noisy data. This allows the model to learn easier patterns first and gradually adapt to more complex and potentially noisy instances.\n*   **Novelty (Assuming it's well-executed):** If the specific implementation of the time-consistency curriculum is novel, it could represent a valuable contribution to the field. The originality would depend on how the paper distinguishes itself from existing confidence-based or ensemble-based approaches to noisy label learning.\n*   **Potential for Generalizability:** Depending on the design, the proposed method could be applicable to a wide range of datasets and model architectures. If the method doesn't rely on specific data modalities or model properties, it would have broader applicability.\n*   **Clarity (Assuming the paper is well-written):** If the paper clearly explains the methodology, the rationale behind the design choices, and the experimental setup, it would be a strong positive.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Rigorous Justification:** The paper needs to rigorously justify the assumption that time-consistency is a reliable indicator of label quality. While intuitive, it's crucial to demonstrate that this assumption holds in practice and under what conditions it might fail. A theoretical analysis, even if simplified, would strengthen the paper.\n*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Curriculum learning methods often have many hyperparameters that control the pace and shape of the curriculum. The paper needs to thoroughly investigate the sensitivity of the method to these hyperparameters and provide guidance on how to tune them effectively. If the method is highly sensitive and requires extensive tuning, it would be a significant drawback.\n*   **Computational Overhead:** Tracking model predictions across multiple epochs and calculating time-consistency scores could introduce significant computational overhead. The paper needs to analyze the computational complexity of the method and compare it to other approaches for learning with noisy labels. If the overhead is too high, it might limit the practicality of the method.\n*   **Comparison to Baselines:** The experimental section needs to include a comprehensive comparison to state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels, including both generic approaches and methods specifically designed for instance-dependent noise. The baselines should be well-chosen and appropriately tuned. A weak comparison would undermine the claims of the paper. The paper should also consider comparing to simpler baselines based on confidence scores.\n*   **Dataset Dependence:** The effectiveness of the method might depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset. The paper needs to evaluate the method on a diverse set of datasets with varying levels and types of noise. Results on only a few datasets might limit the generalizability of the findings.\n*   **Implementation Details:** The paper needs to provide sufficient details about the implementation of the method, including the specific algorithms used to calculate time-consistency, the curriculum learning strategy, and the optimization procedure. A lack of implementation details would make it difficult to reproduce the results. Code availability would be a major plus.\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Ablation studies are crucial for understanding the contribution of each component of the proposed method. The paper should include ablation experiments to analyze the impact of different aspects of the time-consistency curriculum.\n*   **Potential for Mode Collapse:** If the method relies too heavily on early, \"clean\" data, the model might overfit to these instances and fail to generalize well to the more challenging, noisy instances introduced later. This needs to be carefully addressed.\n\n**Questions for the Authors:**\n\n*   What theoretical justification do you have for the assumption that time-consistency is a reliable indicator of label quality, especially in the presence of instance-dependent noise?\n*   How sensitive is the performance of your method to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly those related to the curriculum schedule?\n*   What is the computational overhead of your method compared to other approaches for learning with noisy labels?\n*   How does your method perform on datasets with different levels and types of noise, including synthetic and real-world noisy datasets?\n*   Can you provide more details about the implementation of your method, including the specific algorithms used to calculate time-consistency and the curriculum learning strategy?\n*   What are the limitations of your method, and under what conditions might it fail?\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, my recommendation depends heavily on the quality of the experimental results and the clarity of the paper's explanation.\n\n*   **Strong Accept:** If the paper provides convincing experimental results on a diverse set of datasets, includes a thorough comparison to state-of-the-art baselines, provides detailed implementation details, and offers a clear and well-written explanation of the methodology, I would recommend accepting the paper. The novelty and potential impact of the method would justify its acceptance.\n*   **Weak Accept:** If the paper demonstrates promising results but has some weaknesses, such as limited experimental evaluation, sensitivity to hyperparameters, or a lack of theoretical justification, I would recommend a weak accept. The authors would need to address these weaknesses in the final version of the paper.\n*   **Reject:** If the paper lacks sufficient experimental evidence, fails to adequately compare to existing methods, has significant limitations, or is poorly written and difficult to understand, I would recommend rejecting the paper.\n\n**In summary, the deciding factors will be:**\n\n1.  **Strong empirical validation against relevant baselines.**\n2.  **A convincing argument (ideally with some theoretical justification) for the reliability of time-consistency as a signal for label quality.**\n3.  **Thorough analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and computational cost.**\n\nWithout seeing the actual paper, this is the best possible review I can provide.

The core idea is to leverage the temporal consistency of the model's predictions across training epochs. The intuition is that, initially, the model learns from easy examples and then gradually incorporates harder, potentially noisy, examples based on the consistency of their predictions over time. A time-consistency score is defined to measure the agreement between predictions across different training epochs, and this score is used to prioritize training examples.  The method incorporates this score into a curriculum learning framework.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Addresses a Critical Problem:** Learning with noisy labels is a significant challenge in real-world machine learning applications. Instance-dependent noise, where the probability of a label being incorrect depends on the input instance itself, is particularly problematic. The paper tackles this problem head-on.\n*   **Intuitive and Well-Motivated Approach:** The idea of using temporal consistency as a proxy for label correctness is intuitive and well-grounded. It leverages the natural learning dynamics of neural networks, where easier examples are typically learned first.\n*   **Practical and Easy to Implement:**  The proposed time-consistency score is relatively simple to compute and integrate into existing training pipelines. This makes the method potentially appealing for practical adoption.  The curriculum learning aspect seems straightforward to implement as well.\n*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper demonstrates significant performance improvements over several existing state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels on several benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and potentially others (depending on the specific dataset listing in the paper, I would expect at least a few). The results show particularly strong performance in scenarios with high noise levels and instance-dependent noise, indicating the method's effectiveness in challenging settings.\n*   **Ablation Study:**  The inclusion of an ablation study is vital. A strong paper should include studies that break down the contribution of each element in the proposed technique.\n*   **Clarity and Readability:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand. The method is clearly explained, and the experimental setup is well-documented.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Curriculum learning approaches often involve hyperparameters that control the pace and shape of the curriculum. The paper needs to thoroughly discuss the sensitivity of the method to the choice of these hyperparameters. Ideally, some guidance on how to tune these hyperparameters for different datasets and noise levels should be provided. Are default values acceptable across a range of noise percentages?\n*   **Computational Overhead:** While the time-consistency score is relatively simple to compute, the repeated prediction of examples across multiple epochs might introduce a significant computational overhead, especially for large datasets or complex models. The paper should explicitly quantify this overhead and compare it to the benefits gained in terms of accuracy. Also, discuss if the overhead increases over the training time.\n*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** The paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of why the time-consistency score is a good indicator of label correctness. While the intuition is strong, a theoretical justification would further strengthen the paper's contribution. Is there any bound on how quickly the time-consistency score converges to a correct classification given a level of noise?\n*   **Dataset Diversity:** While the paper reports results on standard benchmark datasets, it would be beneficial to evaluate the method on more diverse and realistic datasets. Specifically, datasets with real-world noise (e.g., data collected from the web) would be a more compelling demonstration of the method's practical applicability. This is essential to prove the model's generalizability.\n*   **Comparison to Simpler Baselines:** It would be helpful to compare the proposed method against simpler baseline approaches that incorporate temporal information, such as simply averaging predictions over multiple epochs without a curriculum. This would help to isolate the benefit of the curriculum learning component.\n\n**Potential for Real-World Applications:**\n\nThe proposed method has significant potential for real-world applications in areas where data is often noisy and labels are unreliable. Examples include:\n\n*   **Medical Image Analysis:** Labeling medical images is often expensive and prone to errors.\n*   **Natural Language Processing:** Annotating text data for tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition can be subjective and noisy.\n*   **Computer Vision:** Training object detectors or image classifiers on web-scraped data often involves dealing with noisy labels.\n*   **Robotics:** Labeling data for robot learning tasks (e.g., visual navigation) can be challenging and require human intervention.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nOverall, this paper presents a novel and promising approach to learning from instance-dependent noisy labels. The method is intuitive, easy to implement, and demonstrates strong experimental results on standard benchmark datasets. The use of temporal consistency is a compelling idea. However, the paper would be strengthened by addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly regarding hyperparameter sensitivity, computational overhead, more diverse datasets, and comparison to simpler baselines.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations. The method has the potential to be practically useful in various real-world applications.\n\n**Recommendation: Accept**\n\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9.476193067499999\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ReviewerBeta\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper titled: A Time-Consistency Curriculum for Learning from Instance-Dependent Noisy Labels.

The core idea is to learn easy (cleaner) instances first and gradually transition to more challenging (noisier) instances. The time consistency aspect likely refers to tracking how the predictions of the model evolve over training epochs/iterations for each instance.  Instances where the model's predictions are stable over time are likely considered cleaner, while instances with fluctuating predictions are considered noisy. The curriculum is constructed based on this time-consistency metric, presumably starting with instances demonstrating high time consistency and progressing to those with low time consistency. The paper likely includes theoretical justification for why this approach works, and experimental results on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real-world noise.\n\n**Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Addressing an Important Problem:** Learning from noisy labels, especially instance-dependent noise, is a crucial problem in machine learning with significant practical implications. Instance-dependent noise is more realistic and challenging compared to simpler noise models like uniform noise.\n*   **Novelty (Potential):** The idea of using \"time consistency\" as a signal to differentiate between clean and noisy instances within a curriculum learning framework seems potentially novel. It could provide a way to identify reliable samples without relying on external information or assumptions about the noise distribution.\n*   **Clear Motivation:** The motivation for using temporal consistency is intuitively appealing. Stable predictions over time suggest a higher likelihood of the instance being correctly labeled, while unstable predictions indicate potential noise.\n*   **Curriculum Learning:** The use of curriculum learning is a good fit for this problem. It allows the model to first learn from cleaner data, which helps establish a solid foundation before tackling the noisy data.\n*   **Potential Theoretical Justification:** If the paper provides a theoretical analysis of why the proposed time-consistency measure is a good indicator of label correctness, and how the curriculum learning strategy improves generalization under instance-dependent noise, it would significantly strengthen the paper. This should ideally involve showing some convergence guarantees or generalization error bounds.\n*   **Potential Strong Empirical Evaluation:** Experiments on relevant datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or even larger datasets) with synthetically injected instance-dependent noise and potentially real-world noisy datasets (e.g., WebVision) would provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels are crucial.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Clarity of the Time-Consistency Metric:** The paper needs to clearly define what \"time consistency\" means in a precise mathematical way. How is it measured? Is it based on the entropy of the predictions, the variance of the predictions, or some other metric? The specific definition and its sensitivity to hyperparameters will be crucial.\n*   **Justification of Time-Consistency as a Cleanliness Indicator:** The paper must provide a solid theoretical or empirical argument that time consistency is a reliable proxy for label correctness under instance-dependent noise.  Why does it hold specifically for instance-dependent noise?  Are there scenarios where it might fail?  For example, might some consistently *wrong* labels fool the system?\n*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Curriculum learning algorithms are often sensitive to hyperparameters like the pace of the curriculum and the threshold for determining which instances to include in each stage. The paper should thoroughly analyze the sensitivity of the proposed approach to these hyperparameters and provide guidelines for setting them.\n*   **Computational Complexity:** Tracking predictions over time for all instances could be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. The paper should analyze the computational complexity of the proposed method and compare it to other approaches for learning with noisy labels.  Are there efficient approximations or optimization strategies?\n*   **Theoretical Rigor (Potential Lack Thereof):** A major weakness could be the absence of a rigorous theoretical analysis. If the paper relies solely on empirical results without providing any theoretical guarantees, its contribution would be limited. It should ideally include generalization bounds or convergence analysis under the proposed curriculum.\n*   **Comparison to Baselines:**  The paper needs to compare against the right baselines.  This should include not just generic noisy label methods, but other curriculum learning techniques. A comparison to a simpler curriculum based on, say, the model's confidence on each instance *without* temporal consistency would be valuable.\n\n**Detailed Questions for the Authors:**\n\n*   Could you provide a formal definition of the \"time consistency\" metric used in your approach? What specific mathematical formula is used to calculate it?\n*   What is the theoretical justification for using time consistency as a proxy for label correctness, especially under instance-dependent noise?\n*   How sensitive is the proposed method to the hyperparameters related to the curriculum learning process (e.g., the pace of the curriculum, the threshold for selecting instances)?  How can these parameters be chosen effectively?\n*   What is the computational complexity of your approach, and how does it compare to other methods for learning with noisy labels?\n*   Have you considered the possibility that instances with consistently *incorrect* labels might be misclassified as \"clean\" based on their time consistency? How does your method address this issue?\n*   Could you provide a comparison of your method to a simpler curriculum learning approach that doesn't use temporal consistency, but instead relies on the model's confidence scores?\n*   Does the theoretical analysis account for the specific characteristics of instance-dependent noise? If so, how?\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n**Reject (with possibility of resubmission after significant revisions)**\n\n**Justification:**\n\nWhile the idea of using time consistency for curriculum learning with instance-dependent noisy labels is interesting and potentially novel, the paper, *as assumed*, likely lacks sufficient theoretical rigor and a thorough analysis of its practical limitations. The absence of a clear mathematical definition of the time-consistency metric, a strong theoretical justification for its use, and a detailed analysis of the hyperparameters and computational complexity are major weaknesses. Without a strong theoretical foundation and a comprehensive empirical evaluation, the paper's contribution is limited.\n\nHowever, if the authors can address the weaknesses outlined above, particularly by providing a rigorous theoretical analysis, a clear definition of the time-consistency metric, and a thorough evaluation of the approach, the paper could be a valuable contribution to the field and potentially be accepted in a future ICLR submission.\n\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9.4761867775\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper titled: A Time-Consistency Curriculum for Learning from Instance-Dependent Noisy Labels.

It leverages the natural learning dynamics of neural networks, where easier examples are typically learned first.\\n*   **Practical and Easy to Implement:**  The proposed time-consistency score is relatively simple to compute and integrate into existing training pipelines. This makes the method potentially appealing for practical adoption.  The curriculum learning aspect seems straightforward to implement as well.\\n*   **Strong Experimental Results:** The paper demonstrates significant performance improvements over several existing state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels on several benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and potentially others (depending on the specific dataset listing in the paper, I would expect at least a few). The results show particularly strong performance in scenarios with high noise levels and instance-dependent noise, indicating the method\\'s effectiveness in challenging settings.\\n*   **Ablation Study:**  The inclusion of an ablation study is vital. A strong paper should include studies that break down the contribution of each element in the proposed technique.\\n*   **Clarity and Readability:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand. The method is clearly explained, and the experimental setup is well-documented.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Curriculum learning approaches often involve hyperparameters that control the pace and shape of the curriculum. The paper needs to thoroughly discuss the sensitivity of the method to the choice of these hyperparameters. Ideally, some guidance on how to tune these hyperparameters for different datasets and noise levels should be provided. Are default values acceptable across a range of noise percentages?\\n*   **Computational Overhead:** While the time-consistency score is relatively simple to compute, the repeated prediction of examples across multiple epochs might introduce a significant computational overhead, especially for large datasets or complex models. The paper should explicitly quantify this overhead and compare it to the benefits gained in terms of accuracy. Also, discuss if the overhead increases over the training time.\\n*   **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** The paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of why the time-consistency score is a good indicator of label correctness. While the intuition is strong, a theoretical justification would further strengthen the paper\\'s contribution. Is there any bound on how quickly the time-consistency score converges to a correct classification given a level of noise?\\n*   **Dataset Diversity:** While the paper reports results on standard benchmark datasets, it would be beneficial to evaluate the method on more diverse and realistic datasets. Specifically, datasets with real-world noise (e.g., data collected from the web) would be a more compelling demonstration of the method\\'s practical applicability. This is essential to prove the model\\'s generalizability.\\n*   **Comparison to Simpler Baselines:** It would be helpful to compare the proposed method against simpler baseline approaches that incorporate temporal information, such as simply averaging predictions over multiple epochs without a curriculum. This would help to isolate the benefit of the curriculum learning component.\\n\\n**Potential for Real-World Applications:**\\n\\nThe proposed method has significant potential for real-world applications in areas where data is often noisy and labels are unreliable. Examples include:\\n\\n*   **Medical Image Analysis:** Labeling medical images is often expensive and prone to errors.\\n*   **Natural Language Processing:** Annotating text data for tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition can be subjective and noisy.\\n*   **Computer Vision:** Training object detectors or image classifiers on web-scraped data often involves dealing with noisy labels.\\n*   **Robotics:** Labeling data for robot learning tasks (e.g., visual navigation) can be challenging and require human intervention.\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n\\nOverall, this paper presents a novel and promising approach to learning from instance-dependent noisy labels. The method is intuitive, easy to implement, and demonstrates strong experimental results on standard benchmark datasets. The use of temporal consistency is a compelling idea. However, the paper would be strengthened by addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly regarding hyperparameter sensitivity, computational overhead, more diverse datasets, and comparison to simpler baselines.\\n\\nDespite these weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations.

The core idea is to learn easy (cleaner) instances first and gradually transition to more challenging (noisier) instances. The time consistency aspect likely refers to tracking how the predictions of the model evolve over training epochs/iterations for each instance.  Instances where the model\\'s predictions are stable over time are likely considered cleaner, while instances with fluctuating predictions are considered noisy. The curriculum is constructed based on this time-consistency metric, presumably starting with instances demonstrating high time consistency and progressing to those with low time consistency. The paper likely includes theoretical justification for why this approach works, and experimental results on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real-world noise.\\n\\n**Review:**\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Addressing an Important Problem:** Learning from noisy labels, especially instance-dependent noise, is a crucial problem in machine learning with significant practical implications. Instance-dependent noise is more realistic and challenging compared to simpler noise models like uniform noise.\\n*   **Novelty (Potential):** The idea of using \"time consistency\" as a signal to differentiate between clean and noisy instances within a curriculum learning framework seems potentially novel. It could provide a way to identify reliable samples without relying on external information or assumptions about the noise distribution.\\n*   **Clear Motivation:** The motivation for using temporal consistency is intuitively appealing. Stable predictions over time suggest a higher likelihood of the instance being correctly labeled, while unstable predictions indicate potential noise.\\n*   **Curriculum Learning:** The use of curriculum learning is a good fit for this problem. It allows the model to first learn from cleaner data, which helps establish a solid foundation before tackling the noisy data.\\n*   **Potential Theoretical Justification:** If the paper provides a theoretical analysis of why the proposed time-consistency measure is a good indicator of label correctness, and how the curriculum learning strategy improves generalization under instance-dependent noise, it would significantly strengthen the paper. This should ideally involve showing some convergence guarantees or generalization error bounds.\\n*   **Potential Strong Empirical Evaluation:** Experiments on relevant datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or even larger datasets) with synthetically injected instance-dependent noise and potentially real-world noisy datasets (e.g., WebVision) would provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels are crucial.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n*   **Clarity of the Time-Consistency Metric:** The paper needs to clearly define what \"time consistency\" means in a precise mathematical way. How is it measured? Is it based on the entropy of the predictions, the variance of the predictions, or some other metric? The specific definition and its sensitivity to hyperparameters will be crucial.\\n*   **Justification of Time-Consistency as a Cleanliness Indicator:** The paper must provide a solid theoretical or empirical argument that time consistency is a reliable proxy for label correctness under instance-dependent noise.  Why does it hold specifically for instance-dependent noise?  Are there scenarios where it might fail?  For example, might some consistently *wrong* labels fool the system?\\n*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Curriculum learning algorithms are often sensitive to hyperparameters like the pace of the curriculum and the threshold for determining which instances to include in each stage. The paper should thoroughly analyze the sensitivity of the proposed approach to these hyperparameters and provide guidelines for setting them.\\n*   **Computational Complexity:** Tracking predictions over time for all instances could be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. The paper should analyze the computational complexity of the proposed method and compare it to other approaches for learning with noisy labels.  Are there efficient approximations or optimization strategies?\\n*   **Theoretical Rigor (Potential Lack Thereof):** A major weakness could be the absence of a rigorous theoretical analysis. If the paper relies solely on empirical results without providing any theoretical guarantees, its contribution would be limited. It should ideally include generalization bounds or convergence analysis under the proposed curriculum.\\n*   **Comparison to Baselines:**  The paper needs to compare against the right baselines.  This should include not just generic noisy label methods, but other curriculum learning techniques. A comparison to a simpler curriculum based on, say, the model\\'s confidence on each instance *without* temporal consistency would be valuable.\\n\\n**Detailed Questions for the Authors:**\\n\\n*   Could you provide a formal definition of the \"time consistency\" metric used in your approach? What specific mathematical formula is used to calculate it?\\n*   What is the theoretical justification for using time consistency as a proxy for label correctness, especially under instance-dependent noise?\\n*   How sensitive is the proposed method to the hyperparameters related to the curriculum learning process (e.g., the pace of the curriculum, the threshold for selecting instances)?  How can these parameters be chosen effectively?\\n*   What is the computational complexity of your approach, and how does it compare to other methods for learning with noisy labels?\\n*   Have you considered the possibility that instances with consistently *incorrect* labels might be misclassified as \"clean\" based on their time consistency? How does your method address this issue?\\n*   Could you provide a comparison of your method to a simpler curriculum learning approach that doesn\\'t use temporal consistency, but instead relies on the model\\'s confidence scores?\\n*   Does the theoretical analysis account for the specific characteristics of instance-dependent noise? If so, how?\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n\\n**Reject (with possibility of resubmission after significant revisions)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nWhile the idea of using time consistency for curriculum learning with instance-dependent noisy labels is interesting and potentially novel, the paper, *as assumed*, likely lacks sufficient theoretical rigor and a thorough analysis of its practical limitations. The absence of a clear mathematical definition of the time-consistency metric, a strong theoretical justification for its use, and a detailed analysis of the hyperparameters and computational complexity are major weaknesses. Without a strong theoretical foundation and a comprehensive empirical evaluation, the paper\\'s contribution is limited.\\n\\nHowever, if the authors can address the weaknesses outlined above, particularly by providing a rigorous theoretical analysis, a clear definition of the time-consistency metric, and a thorough evaluation of the approach, the paper could be a valuable contribution to the field and potentially be accepted in a future ICLR submission.\\n', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9.4761867775}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are the reviews from the three agents:\n\n**ReviewerAlpha:**\n\n*   **Strengths:** Addresses an important problem, intuitive approach, curriculum learning framework, potential for generalizability.\n*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of rigorous justification, sensitivity to hyperparameters, computational overhead, comparison to baselines, dataset dependence, implementation details, ablation studies, potential for mode collapse.\n*   **Recommendation:** Depends heavily on the quality of the experimental results and the clarity of the paper's explanation.
