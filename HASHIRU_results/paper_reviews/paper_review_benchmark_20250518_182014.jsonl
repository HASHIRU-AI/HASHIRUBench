The paper title is: Budgeted Training for Vision Transformer\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Benefited from the large model capacity, Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have demonstrated their predominant performance on various vision tasks, including object detection (Wang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022b), semantic segmentation (Zheng et al., 2021; Strudel et al., 2021), video understanding (Fan et al., 2021; Arnab et al., 2021), etc. However, these improvements come at huge training costs in which the datasets, the model parameters, and the computation complexities have grown enormous in size. For example, ViT-G/14 with Greedy Soup (Wortsman et al., 2022) achieves 90.9% accuracy on the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) benchmark while having 1843M training parameters and being pretrained on a dataset of 3 billion scale. Under this circumstance, computation resource has been becoming an inevitable overhead that prevents common users from training desired vision models. The methodology of designing modern Transformers is finding the best trade-off between the computation costs and the model performances. Besides the widely used factors like the number of the learnable parameters, the floating point operations (FLOPs) and the inference latency, training cost is also an essential resource that involves training schedule (Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2022), memory usage (Pan et al., 2021) and training-stage complexity (Zhang & He, 2020; Gong et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2020). Therefore, the topic of training Transformers efficiently has received broad research interests, especially considering the large-scale data and prolonged schedules in training. Considering that many of the research labs and companies are not able to afford the full training schedule of the best model, one usual solution is to train a better one given a desirable and acceptable total training cost. Previous works that focus on addressing the training efficiency problem mainly learn model-specific schedules based on handcraft designs (Gong et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020; McDanel & Huynh, 2022) or Automated Machine Learning (Li et al., 2022a). However, these approaches either adjust the costs in the training process, or only provide training schedules based on a sparse set of training costs. The inflexibility hinders from generalizing to a pre-defined budget. In this paper, we take a step forward and focus on the problem of budgeted training (Li et al., 2020), i.e., achieving the highest model performance under any given training budget that can be measured by total training time or computation cost. Specifically, we target this problem from the perspective of the inherent properties of Vision Transformers. We show that there exist several types of redundancies during training ViTs, including the feature diversities across different attention heads, the hidden dimensions in the MLP blocks and the number of attended visual tokens. It is shown that these redundancies are correlated with training process, especially they tend to be higher at early stages. This motivates us to dynamically control the activation rate of the model along the training process, where less parameters participate in the early training stages and the full model capacity is activated at late stages. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), we activate 2 attention heads, 51% tokens and 384 MLP hidden dimensions in the first stage, which condenses the model redundancy and keeps a low computation cost, and then the activation rate of the model then gradually increases as training goes on. In this way, the training process becomes more compact, where information loss is greatly avoided and results in limited influence on the model performance. Based on this technique, we can adjust the duration at different level of training stages in order to accommodate to different training budgets. Fig. 1(a) shows our method consistently outperforms the baseline at three different budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the other budgeted training baselines and achieves competitive training cost-performance trade-off on various Vision Transformer models. 2 RELATED WORKS: Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) firstly introduces the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) model into the vision tasks. Wang et al. (2021a; 2022); Liu et al. (2021; 2022) and Zhang et al. (2021a) incorporate the pyramid model architecture with various efficient attention mechanisms for vision. Following the isotropic design, Yuan et al. (2021) leverages overlapped attention, Touvron et al. (2021) benefits from the knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) and Jiang et al. (2021) proposes the token-labeling technique to improve the data efficiency of the Vision Transformer. Redundancies in Transformers have been widely studied in the area of NLP. Michel et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2021b); Voita et al. (2019) prune the redundant attention heads to improve the model efficiency. Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) takes a step further to reuse attention maps in subsequent layers to reduce computations. In vision tasks, the redundancy among visual tokens are of high interest. Wang et al. (2021b) finds that easy samples can be encoded with less tokens. Rao et al. (2021); Xu et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Liang et al. (2022); Song et al. (2021) explore the redundancies in visual tokens by either pruning tokens or introducing sparse computation. Budgeted Training (Li et al., 2020) focuses on training deep neural networks under certain computational resources constraints by linear decaying learning rates. Chen et al. (2022a) proposes an improved schedule named REX in a profile-sampling fashion. Importance sampling methods (Arazo et al., 2021; Andreis et al., 2020) choose the most valuable subset of training data to reduce the training costs with curriculum learning. Pardo et al. (2021) aims to sample informative subset of training data in weakly-supervised object detection. As for the AutoML, Gao et al. (2021) design an automated system to schedule the training tasks according to the budgets. Li et al. (2022a) searches for the optimal training schedule for each budget. Chen et al. (2022b); McDanel & Huynh (2022) can adjust the number of visual tokens during training to adapt to different budgets. 3 REDUNDANCIES DURING TRAINING VITS:  3.1 BACKGROUND OF VISION TRANSFORMER: We first revisit the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). As the variant of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), ViT divides the input H\u00d7W image into a sequence of p\u00d7 p patches in the length of N = HW/p2, and embeds them with linear projections into the Cdimensional subspace. After prepended with a class token and added by a set of position embeddings, the patch embeddings go through subsequent ViT blocks to extract features. The basic building block of ViT consists of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer. The visual tokens are sequentially processed by every block, with LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) and residual connections. Let zl \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the output tokens from the l-th block, the block of ViT is formulated as z\u2032l = zl + MHSA(LN(zl)), zl+1 = z \u2032 l + MLP(LN(z \u2032 l)). (1) The MHSA is introduced to learn different representations from separate attention heads. Let q,k,v \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the query, key and value tokens projected by learnable weights Wq,Wk,Wv \u2208 RC\u00d7C , the attention of the m-th head among M heads is computed as h(m) = softmax ( q(m)k(m)\u22a4/ \u221a d ) v(m), (2) where d = C/m is the dimension of each head. And then the attention heads are concatenated together to produce the final output, followed by a linear projection WO \u2208 RC\u00d7C , written as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M))WO. (3) The MLP is implemented as two fully-connected layers denoted as \u03d51(\u00b7) and \u03d52(\u00b7), with a GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) non-linearity inserted between them. The \u03d51(\u00b7) takes in the tokens with C1 dimension and projects them to a subspace with dimension C2 \u2265 C1. After the activation, these tokens are projected back to C1 dimension as the output of the MLP. We denote the proportion \u03b3 = C2/C1 as the MLP ratio in the remaining paper. In this section we opt a representative ViT architecture, DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), to analyze the redundancies in ViT training. The same conclusions can be generalized to other Transformer architectures. 3.2 REDUNDANCIES IN ATTENTION HEADS: There are six heads in each MHSA layer of DeiT-S, where each head holds a 64-dim representation to compute self-attention. A question will be raised: are all the heads important? In the natural language processing (NLP), it has been observed that zeroing out the representations of some heads or even keeping only one head active is enough to preserve the model performance at the test time (Michel et al., 2019). Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) finds that the attention maps of heads share high similarities between consecutive layers in both vision and NLP tasks. However, few studies inspect this question from the perspective of training. We compare the CKA similarity between every pair of heads to assess their redundancies. CKA is short for centered kernel alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019; Raghu et al., 2021; Cortes et al., 2012), which is a popular metric to quantize the similarity between the representation of each head. CKA takes two activation matrices X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p1 ,Y \u2208 Rm\u00d7p2 in the networks as input, and computes the Gram matrices L = XX\u22a4,K = YY\u22a4. By centering the Gram matrices by H = I \u2212 1m11 \u22a4, K\u0304 = HKH, L\u0304 = HLH, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2007) and the CKA are computed as CKA(K,L) = HSIC(K,L)\u221a HSIC(K,K)HSIC(L,L) , HSIC(K,L) = vec(K\u0304) \u00b7 vec(L\u0304) (m\u2212 1)2 . (4) We compute the CKA(h(i)l ,h (j) l ) for each pair of the i-th and the j-th head in the l-th block of the DeiT-S model on ImageNet validation set, where h(i)l is the output feature of every separate head attention in Eq.(2) before the concatenation and projection in Eq.(3). As shown in Fig. 2(a), there are significant descents of these similarities in some multi-head attention blocks. For example, the CKA score in block04 first grows over 0.6 and rapidly decreases to nearly zero as training goes on. To show this trend more clearly, Fig. 2(b) displays the dynamics of similarity matrices at different epochs. From these observations, there exist considerable redundancies between the attention heads and the redundancies are decreasing during the training, which enlightens us to activate fewer heads during the early stage of the training. 3.3 REDUNDANCIES IN MLP HIDDEN DIMENSIONS: The dimension expansion and contraction design in the MLP layer of ViTs extracts features by projecting and activating them in a higher-dimensional space, which brings in a great deal of redundancies in features. The searched optimal architectures in ViT-Slim (Chavan et al., 2022) also reveal this type of redundancy in which lots of the hidden dimensions in MLP layers are removed. In terms of training, we leverage the principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze these redundancies among the features in the expanded dimension space projected by \u03d51(\u00b7) in the MLP block. For each token \u03d51(x) \u2208 RN\u00d7C2 in the MLP block of DeiTS, we compute its number of principal components that hold a given proportion of the explained variance. This criterion has been also adopted in pruning redundant neurons in deep networks (Casper et al., 2021). We choose the 99% threshold to measure the alternation of the principal components distribution during training. We plot the numbers of principal components w.r.t. the training epochs in Fig. 3. It is observed that the numbers of principal components are growing as the training epoch increases in the shallow and middle blocks. This phenomenon indicates that in the early training stages, only a few components can hold the most explained variances, i.e., support the projected space. Therefore the redundancies in the early stages of training are in high degree, especially in the shallow blocks. For the deep blocks there also exist the trends of increase of the numbers of components, however they are relatively noisy so we omit them in the figure. This observation demonstrates that the features are highly linearly dependent in early epochs, lacking diversities among dimensions. As the training goes on, the redundan- cies are gradually declining, achieving a final state with much fewer redundancies. It suggests that a large MLP ratio \u03b3 with high hidden dimensions at the early training stage be excessive and a growing \u03b3 from a smaller value would be beneficial to alleviating this redundancy. 3.4 REDUNDANCIES IN VISUAL TOKENS: The spatial redundancies in the visual tokens have been widely studied. Many efficient Vision Transformers have sought to eliminate the redundancies during inference time (Wang et al., 2021b; Rao et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022). We follow this line of research to investigate the redundancies among tokens during the training procedure, leveraging the visualization of the class attention. The class attention score is defined as the attention between the class token qcls and other patch tokens k, i.e., Acls = softmax(qclsk\u22a4/ \u221a d). If we view these attention scores as a distribution, the patch tokens with high scores contribute more to the class token, which indicates the informative tokens of the important image patches. As illustrated in Fig. 4, we observe that the patch tokens with higher attention scores first emerge in a small area of the image. And then more patches on the target object begin to get a higher class attention score during training, indicating there are some redundancies in the patch tokens at the early stage of training. This phenomenon exists in some shallow blocks while the class attention in the deep blocks displays a nearly uniform distribution among all visual tokens. Since the effective receptive field of ViTs grow very quickly as the block goes deeper (d\u2019Ascoli et al., 2021; Raghu et al., 2021), the class attention degenerates to a global-pooling operation to aggregate all the tokens. This trend appeals to us to reduce the number of visual tokens in early epochs. 4 BUDGETED TRAINING FOR VISION TRANSFORMER: Different from most of the previous works that improves training efficiency based on a fixed schedule, our target is to propose a flexible training framework that can easily adapt to a wide range of training budgets while maintaining competitive performances. In the following, we would first define the problem of budgeted training and then show how we solve the problem by leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers. 4.1 BUDGETED TRAINING: The total cost of training a deep neural network M can be defined as the accumulation of the model\u2019s computation cost over all the training steps. The budgeted training problem is to minimize the objective loss such that the total computation costs C(M) of training are under the given budget constraint B, min \u0398 L(M;D), s.t. C(M) = \u222b Tmax 0 C(T ;M) dT \u2264 B, (5) where C(T ;M) is the computation cost of the model M at the T -th training epoch. Nevertheless, considering the computational intractability of the integration and the potential additional inefficiency when frequently switching the training cost C(T ;M) at different epochs, we simplify the optimization problem by dividing the total training process into several stages and hypothesize the training cost remains unchanged in each stage. Specifically, we divide a training procedure with Tmax epochs into K stages satisfying \u2211K k=1 Tk = Tmax, and we denote Ck as the training cost of model M at the k-th stage. In this way, the optimization can be formulated as: min \u0398 L(f(X;\u0398),Y), s.t. K\u2211 k=1 CkTk \u2264 B, (6) where f(\u00b7;\u0398) is the deep neural network M parameterized by its weights \u0398, {(X,Y) \u2208 D} is the input-label pair of training samples and L(\u00b7, \u00b7) defines the loss function of the objective. Also, it is noticeable that when we set B = CK and Tmax = TK = B/CK , it decreases to the common training schedule where full model is trained for all training epochs. 4.2 LEVERAGING REDUNDANCIES IN VISION TRANSFORMER: Most previous works (Li et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022a) that focus on budgeted training propose to adjust the length of training epochs to meet the specific demand on the total training cost. Despite its simplicity, these approaches usually suffer from inherent limitations that fail to make use of the model\u2019s characteristics. Nevertheless, the analysis in Sec. 3 motivates us to tackle this task from an alternative perspective, where we focus on leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers along the training process. Specifically, we focus on the number of attention heads, MLP hidden dimension, and the number of visual tokens that have shown great redundancies in Vision Transformers, and propose to reduce their complexity with respect to the training stages. Given a Vision Transformer with M attention heads. Denote C as the MLP hidden dimension and N as the number of visual tokens for each input image. At the first stage of training, only part of the attention heads are activated and the multi-head self-attention in Eq.(3) can be reformulated as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M (1)))W (1) O , (7) where M (1) denotes the number of activated head, and W(1)O \u2208 R m M C\u00d7C contains the m/M part of the input dimension of the original projection matrix WO. The projection matrices Wq,Wk,Wv for queries, keys and values are adjusted in the same way by activating m/M of their output dimensions, i.e., W(1)q ,W (1) k ,W (1) v \u2208 RC\u00d7 m M C . Similarly, for MLP hidden dimension, only C(1)2 of C2 channels are activated in the MLP layers by incorporating a smaller MLP ratio \u03b3. We illustrate the growing process of the MLP ratio in Fig. 5, and the growing of attention heads follow the same recipe. As for the number of visual tokens, we manually drop some of the tokens, and only reserve N (1) to extract the image features. In practice, we set higher prior on the center region of the image, and mainly drop the tokens at the edges of image to avoid severe information loss. As the training progresses, the redundancies in the aforementioned aspects are gradually decreased. Also, model performances will be highly restricted as the model complexity is limited. Therefore, for later stages in the training schedule, we propose to gradually turn on the inactive part of the model, and eventually recover the model capacity by activating the whole model. However, comparing to the activated components that have been trained for a certain of epochs, the inactive part remains the same status as initialization, which is usually randomly sampled from a certain distribution. In this way, simply adding these parts to the training process may result in an imbalance of optimization, and results in degraded model performances. This problem is inevitable when activating the learnable weights for additional attention heads and MLP ratio. Therefore, to avoid the training instability, we propose to make use of the activated parts, and use their weights as the initialization. To avoid having same gradient with copied parameters, we choose to drop the statistical information of the parameters reserved in the optimizer, including their first and second order momenta in the AdamW. Consequently, this results in a diverse gradient direction, and successfully maintain the training stability. 4.3 ADAPTING VISION TRANSFORMER TO BUDGETS: By leveraging the technique we described in Sec. 4.2, the training cost of the models at different stages Ck are controlled according to the fraction of activated components. In this way, given any training budget B, we carefully adjust the duration of each stages Tk and finally satisfies the training constraint \u2211K k=1 CkTk \u2264 B in Eq.(6). Specifically, we employ a family of exponential functions as the prior distribution to sample the duration of each training stage. K random seeds are first sampled from a uniform distribution in the range (0, 1), and then mapped by an exponential function parameterized by a scalar \u03b1: tk = exp (\u03b1sk). The scalar \u03b1 practically reflects the sampling bias towards different stages, i.e., a larger \u03b1 induces larger tks for the later training stages and smaller tks for the early ones. Finally, to fit the total training cost into given training budget, we linearly scale the duration of each stages: Tk = \u230aB/ K\u2211 k=1 bk\u230btk. (8) 5 EXPERIMENTS:  5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: Datasets and models. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet-1K (Deng et al., 2009) dataset for large scale image recognition, which contains 1.28M training examples and 50K validation examples of 1000 classes. We choose three famous families of Vision Transformers, DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), Pyramid Vision Transformer v2 (PVTv2) (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021). DeiT is a classical yet powerful baseline of the isotropic ViTs while PVTv2 and Swin Transformer serve as strong baselines of the ViTs with multiscale feature structures. Implementation details. We follow most of the hyper-parameters of these models including architecture configurations, data augmentations, and stochastic depth rate (Huang et al., 2016). As discussed in Sec. 4.2, we adjust three factors controlling the training cost of the model, including the number of the activated attention heads M , the MLP hidden dimension C, and the proportion of patch tokens N . The detailed specifications are summarized in the appendix. In our method, we choose a moderate \u03b1 = 2.0 in K = 3 training stages. Baselines. In the field of budgeted training, there are two approaches by scheduling learning rate, among which Linear-LR (Li et al., 2020) propose a linear learning rate decay schedule and REXLR (Chen et al., 2022a) design a schedule reflecting the exponential decay. We select these two popular and recent methods as our baselines, which adapt to the given training budget by compressing total epochs in training. For example, let Tmax be the maximum epoch in training at full budget, the two baselines set the epochs to T = 0.5Tmax to meet the 50% budget. Specifically, Linear-LR and REX-LR formulate the learning rate schedules \u03b7linear and \u03b7REX as \u03b7linear(t) = \u03b70(1\u2212 t/T ), \u03b7REX(t) = \u03b70 ( 1\u2212 t/T 0.5 + 0.5(1\u2212 t/T ) ) , (9) where \u03b70 is the initial learning rate, t, T are the current epoch and the total epochs in training. 5.2 BUDGETED TRAINING OF VITS: We report the results of our method and the budgeted training baselines on DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), PVTv2-b2linear (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin-S (Liu et al., 2021). The training cost is the sum of the FLOPs of the model along all the epochs in training. We choose 25%, 50% and 75% for budgeted training. For the learning rate scheduler baselines, we directly discount the number of epochs from 300 to 75, 150, and 225 respectively. For our method, we sample each Tk under the given budget to fit the constraint by Eq.(8). 100% training budget:  75% training budget:  50% training budget:  25% training budget: We summarize our results in Tab. 1, in which our method outperforms two baselines consistently on the three models in terms of Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K validation dataset. For DeiT-S, our method achieves +1.3%, +0.8%, and +0.5% over the baselines on the three training budgets. For The results on PVTv2 and Swin-S models also shows the superiority of our method to the learning rate scheduling techniques. When using full training budget, our method has significant improvements in 1.0% over the original models. Fig. 6 also illustrates the effectiveness of our method. 5.3 ANALYSES: Restricting training epochs. We add another extra constraint that the number of total epochs is limited to 300 as the original model to check the flexibility of our framework. Tab. 2 shows that if the total epochs remain unchanged as the training budget goes low, the training cost is likely to exceed the budget and the performances of models are faded. Therefore, the total epochs should be adjusted according to the budgets in the scheme of multiple stages of different model complexities. Training time. We report the training time of our methods on DeiT-S in Tab. 3. Under 75% FLOPs training budget, our framework saves the training time over 11% in terms of GPU hours without performance drop. Under other budgets, our method also achieves considerable time saving with competitive model performances. Because the total training time is heavily influenced by the CPUs and I/O of the file system, we measure the time of forward and backward passes only to further assess the time saving. It is observed that the saved foward and backward time is more close to the saved training budgets, which implies our method could save more training time in total provided optimized hardware systems. 5.4 ABLATION STUDY: Scalar \u03b1 in Tk sampling controls the growth rate of the exponential function. As shown in Tab. 4, \u03b1 = 5.0 compress the first two stages in less than 20 epochs. When \u03b1 is large enough, the epochs of last training stage TK will dominate all the training epochs, which comes to the case CK = B as Li et al. (2020). If \u03b1 is set to 0, all tks are equal. And when \u03b1 is negative, early tks will become large rather than the later tks, which results in degradation in model performance by -0.7% and -0.9%. Different activated components. As summarized in Tab. 5, we evaluate different types of combination of the activated components on DeiT-S with a fixed schedule [50,100,150]. M , N , C mean adopting the attention heads, tokens and MLP hidden dimensions as the activated components, respectively. The more components partially activated we used in budgeted training, the more training cost we save. We also observe that the number of tokens N is the key to reducing training cost. The number of stage K. To verify the effectiveness of different stage number K in our proposed framework, we choose K = 2, 3, 4 and evaluate the schedules under the similar budgets in the paper. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7, from which we find that K = 3 outperforms K = 2, 4 in all the budgets, thus K = 3 is adopted in our method. 6 CONCLUSION: This paper presents a novel framework for training Vision Transformers at any given budget by reducing the inherent redundancies of the model at the early training stages. We investigate three redundancy factors in Vision Transformers, including attention heads, hidden dimensions in MLP, and visual tokens. Based on these observations, we propose a training strategy to dynamically adjust the activation rate of the model along the training process. Extensive experiments show the effusiveness of our framework with competitive performances on a wide range of training budgets. B RESULTS ON DEIT-B: For DeiT-B, we evaluate our method under the same budgets of 25%, 50% and 75%. As shown in Table 7, there are almost no performance drops of our method as the budgets go smaller whereas the baselines degrade in a large magnitude. Because DeiT-B is a much wider model than DeiT-S, it has more redundancies that can be exploited during training. Nonetheless, larger models require more optimization iterations to converge than the smaller ones, which explains the poor results of the baselines. C MORE ABLATION STUDY: Using less tokens. We provide another baseline of using less tokens by selecting about 25%, 50% and 75% patch tokens in DeiT-S, as shown in Table 9. We observe that only reducing the tokens to save space consumption leads to a sharp performance drop. The implementation of the weights copy. We also investigate the different ways to growing the weight matrices of the projections in the MHSA layer and the MLP layer, as shown in Table 8. We try a total random initialization for the newly activated dimensions, but resulting in a poor performance as listed in the first row. The second row shows that only copying parameters brings about a good performance. Nevertheless, copying the states stored in the optimizer along with the parameters is damaging as the symmetry of the optimization leads to the duplicate weights. The compensation of the replications proposed in (Chen et al., 2015) by multiplying 0.5 in the outgoing weights helps to lift the accuracy to 78.5. However only using this \u00d70.5 technique or adding noise to the grown weights do not help a lot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will create three agents with different personalities to review the provided paper and make a recommendation for ICLR 2023.

The paper title is: Budgeted Training for Vision Transformer. INTRODUCTION: Benefited from the large model capacity, Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have demonstrated their predominant performance on various vision tasks, including object detection (Wang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022b), semantic segmentation (Zheng et al., 2021; Strudel et al., 2021), video understanding (Fan et al., 2021; Arnab et al., 2021), etc. However, these improvements come at huge training costs in which the datasets, the model parameters, and the computation complexities have grown enormous in size. For example, ViT-G/14 with Greedy Soup (Wortsman et al., 2022) achieves 90.9% accuracy on the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) benchmark while having 1843M training parameters and being pretrained on a dataset of 3 billion scale. Under this circumstance, computation resource has been becoming an inevitable overhead that prevents common users from training desired vision models. The methodology of designing modern Transformers is finding the best trade-off between the computation costs and the model performances. Besides the widely used factors like the number of the learnable parameters, the floating point operations (FLOPs) and the inference latency, training cost is also an essential resource that involves training schedule (Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2022), memory usage (Pan et al., 2021) and training-stage complexity (Zhang & He, 2020; Gong et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2020). Therefore, the topic of training Transformers efficiently has received broad research interests, especially considering the large-scale data and prolonged schedules in training. Considering that many of the research labs and companies are not able to afford the full training schedule of the best model, one usual solution is to train a better one given a desirable and acceptable total training cost. Previous works that focus on addressing the training efficiency problem mainly learn model-specific schedules based on handcraft designs (Gong et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020; McDanel & Huynh, 2022) or Automated Machine Learning (Li et al., 2022a). However, these approaches either adjust the costs in the training process, or only provide training schedules based on a sparse set of training costs. The inflexibility hinders from generalizing to a pre-defined budget. In this paper, we take a step forward and focus on the problem of budgeted training (Li et al., 2020), i.e., achieving the highest model performance under any given training budget that can be measured by total training time or computation cost. Specifically, we target this problem from the perspective of the inherent properties of Vision Transformers. We show that there exist several types of redundancies during training ViTs, including the feature diversities across different attention heads, the hidden dimensions in the MLP blocks and the number of attended visual tokens. It is shown that these redundancies are correlated with training process, especially they tend to be higher at early stages. This motivates us to dynamically control the activation rate of the model along the training process, where less parameters participate in the early training stages and the full model capacity is activated at late stages. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), we activate 2 attention heads, 51% tokens and 384 MLP hidden dimensions in the first stage, which condenses the model redundancy and keeps a low computation cost, and then the activation rate of the model then gradually increases as training goes on. In this way, the training process becomes more compact, where information loss is greatly avoided and results in limited influence on the model performance. Based on this technique, we can adjust the duration at different level of training stages in order to accommodate to different training budgets. Fig. 1(a) shows our method consistently outperforms the baseline at three different budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the other budgeted training baselines and achieves competitive training cost-performance trade-off on various Vision Transformer models. 2 RELATED WORKS: Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) firstly introduces the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) model into the vision tasks. Wang et al. (2021a; 2022); Liu et al. (2021; 2022) and Zhang et al. (2021a) incorporate the pyramid model architecture with various efficient attention mechanisms for vision. Following the isotropic design, Yuan et al. (2021) leverages overlapped attention, Touvron et al. (2021) benefits from the knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) and Jiang et al. (2021) proposes the token-labeling technique to improve the data efficiency of the Vision Transformer. Redundancies in Transformers have been widely studied in the area of NLP. Michel et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2021b); Voita et al. (2019) prune the redundant attention heads to improve the model efficiency. Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) takes a step further to reuse attention maps in subsequent layers to reduce computations. In vision tasks, the redundancy among visual tokens are of high interest. Wang et al. (2021b) finds that easy samples can be encoded with less tokens. Rao et al. (2021); Xu et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Liang et al. (2022); Song et al. (2021) explore the redundancies in visual tokens by either pruning tokens or introducing sparse computation. Budgeted Training (Li et al., 2020) focuses on training deep neural networks under certain computational resources constraints by linear decaying learning rates. Chen et al. (2022a) proposes an improved schedule named REX in a profile-sampling fashion. Importance sampling methods (Arazo et al., 2021; Andreis et al., 2020) choose the most valuable subset of training data to reduce the training costs with curriculum learning. Pardo et al. (2021) aims to sample informative subset of training data in weakly-supervised object detection. As for the AutoML, Gao et al. (2021) design an automated system to schedule the training tasks according to the budgets. Li et al. (2022a) searches for the optimal training schedule for each budget. Chen et al. (2022b); McDanel & Huynh (2022) can adjust the number of visual tokens during training to adapt to different budgets. 3 REDUNDANCIES DURING TRAINING VITS:  3.1 BACKGROUND OF VISION TRANSFORMER: We first revisit the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). As the variant of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), ViT divides the input H\u00d7W image into a sequence of p\u00d7 p patches in the length of N = HW/p2, and embeds them with linear projections into the Cdimensional subspace. After prepended with a class token and added by a set of position embeddings, the patch embeddings go through subsequent ViT blocks to extract features. The basic building block of ViT consists of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer. The visual tokens are sequentially processed by every block, with LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) and residual connections. Let zl \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the output tokens from the l-th block, the block of ViT is formulated as z\u2032l = zl + MHSA(LN(zl)), zl+1 = z \u2032 l + MLP(LN(z \u2032 l)). (1) The MHSA is introduced to learn different representations from separate attention heads. Let q,k,v \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the query, key and value tokens projected by learnable weights Wq,Wk,Wv \u2208 RC\u00d7C , the attention of the m-th head among M heads is computed as h(m) = softmax ( q(m)k(m)\u22a4/ \u221a d ) v(m), (2) where d = C/m is the dimension of each head. And then the attention heads are concatenated together to produce the final output, followed by a linear projection WO \u2208 RC\u00d7C , written as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M))WO. (3) The MLP is implemented as two fully-connected layers denoted as \u03d51(\u00b7) and \u03d52(\u00b7), with a GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) non-linearity inserted between them. The \u03d51(\u00b7) takes in the tokens with C1 dimension and projects them to a subspace with dimension C2 \u2265 C1. After the activation, these tokens are projected back to C1 dimension as the output of the MLP. We denote the proportion \u03b3 = C2/C1 as the MLP ratio in the remaining paper. In this section we opt a representative ViT architecture, DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), to analyze the redundancies in ViT training. The same conclusions can be generalized to other Transformer architectures. 3.2 REDUNDANCIES IN ATTENTION HEADS: There are six heads in each MHSA layer of DeiT-S, where each head holds a 64-dim representation to compute self-attention. A question will be raised: are all the heads important? In the natural language processing (NLP), it has been observed that zeroing out the representations of some heads or even keeping only one head active is enough to preserve the model performance at the test time (Michel et al., 2019). Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) finds that the attention maps of heads share high similarities between consecutive layers in both vision and NLP tasks. However, few studies inspect this question from the perspective of training. We compare the CKA similarity between every pair of heads to assess their redundancies. CKA is short for centered kernel alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019; Raghu et al., 2021; Cortes et al., 2012), which is a popular metric to quantize the similarity between the representation of each head. CKA takes two activation matrices X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p1 ,Y \u2208 Rm\u00d7p2 in the networks as input, and computes the Gram matrices L = XX\u22a4,K = YY\u22a4. By centering the Gram matrices by H = I \u2212 1m11 \u22a4, K\u0304 = HKH, L\u0304 = HLH, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2007) and the CKA are computed as CKA(K,L) = HSIC(K,L)\u221a HSIC(K,K)HSIC(L,L) , HSIC(K,L) = vec(K\u0304) \u00b7 vec(L\u0304) (m\u2212 1)2 . (4) We compute the CKA(h(i)l ,h (j) l ) for each pair of the i-th and the j-th head in the l-th block of the DeiT-S model on ImageNet validation set, where h(i)l is the output feature of every separate head attention in Eq.(2) before the concatenation and projection in Eq.(3). As shown in Fig. 2(a), there are significant descents of these similarities in some multi-head attention blocks. For example, the CKA score in block04 first grows over 0.6 and rapidly decreases to nearly zero as training goes on. To show this trend more clearly, Fig. 2(b) displays the dynamics of similarity matrices at different epochs. From these observations, there exist considerable redundancies between the attention heads and the redundancies are decreasing during the training, which enlightens us to activate fewer heads during the early stage of the training. 3.3 REDUNDANCIES IN MLP HIDDEN DIMENSIONS: The dimension expansion and contraction design in the MLP layer of ViTs extracts features by projecting and activating them in a higher-dimensional space, which brings in a great deal of redundancies in features. The searched optimal architectures in ViT-Slim (Chavan et al., 2022) also reveal this type of redundancy in which lots of the hidden dimensions in MLP layers are removed. In terms of training, we leverage the principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze these redundancies among the features in the expanded dimension space projected by \u03d51(\u00b7) in the MLP block. For each token \u03d51(x) \u2208 RN\u00d7C2 in the MLP block of DeiTS, we compute its number of principal components that hold a given proportion of the explained variance. This criterion has been also adopted in pruning redundant neurons in deep networks (Casper et al., 2021). We choose the 99% threshold to measure the alternation of the principal components distribution during training. We plot the numbers of principal components w.r.t. the training epochs in Fig. 3. It is observed that the numbers of principal components are growing as the training epoch increases in the shallow and middle blocks. This phenomenon indicates that in the early training stages, only a few components can hold the most explained variances, i.e., support the projected space. Therefore the redundancies in the early stages of training are in high degree, especially in the shallow blocks. For the deep blocks there also exist the trends of increase of the numbers of components, however they are relatively noisy so we omit them in the figure. This observation demonstrates that the features are highly linearly dependent in early epochs, lacking diversities among dimensions. As the training goes on, the redundan- cies are gradually declining, achieving a final state with much fewer redundancies. It suggests that a large MLP ratio \u03b3 with high hidden dimensions at the early training stage be excessive and a growing \u03b3 from a smaller value would be beneficial to alleviating this redundancy. 3.4 REDUNDANCIES IN VISUAL TOKENS: The spatial redundancies in the visual tokens have been widely studied. Many efficient Vision Transformers have sought to eliminate the redundancies during inference time (Wang et al., 2021b; Rao et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022). We follow this line of research to investigate the redundancies among tokens during the training procedure, leveraging the visualization of the class attention. The class attention score is defined as the attention between the class token qcls and other patch tokens k, i.e., Acls = softmax(qclsk\u22a4/ \u221a d). If we view these attention scores as a distribution, the patch tokens with high scores contribute more to the class token, which indicates the informative tokens of the important image patches. As illustrated in Fig. 4, we observe that the patch tokens with higher attention scores first emerge in a small area of the image. And then more patches on the target object begin to get a higher class attention score during training, indicating there are some redundancies in the patch tokens at the early stage of training. This phenomenon exists in some shallow blocks while the class attention in the deep blocks displays a nearly uniform distribution among all visual tokens. Since the effective receptive field of ViTs grow very quickly as the block goes deeper (d\u2019Ascoli et al., 2021; Raghu et al., 2021), the class attention degenerates to a global-pooling operation to aggregate all the tokens. This trend appeals to us to reduce the number of visual tokens in early epochs. 4 BUDGETED TRAINING FOR VISION TRANSFORMER: Different from most of the previous works that improves training efficiency based on a fixed schedule, our target is to propose a flexible training framework that can easily adapt to a wide range of training budgets while maintaining competitive performances. In the following, we would first define the problem of budgeted training and then show how we solve the problem by leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers. 4.1 BUDGETED TRAINING: The total cost of training a deep neural network M can be defined as the accumulation of the model\u2019s computation cost over all the training steps. The budgeted training problem is to minimize the objective loss such that the total computation costs C(M) of training are under the given budget constraint B, min \u0398 L(M;D), s.t. C(M) = \u222b Tmax 0 C(T ;M) dT \u2264 B, (5) where C(T ;M) is the computation cost of the model M at the T -th training epoch. Nevertheless, considering the computational intractability of the integration and the potential additional inefficiency when frequently switching the training cost C(T ;M) at different epochs, we simplify the optimization problem by dividing the total training process into several stages and hypothesize the training cost remains unchanged in each stage. Specifically, we divide a training procedure with Tmax epochs into K stages satisfying \u2211K k=1 Tk = Tmax, and we denote Ck as the training cost of model M at the k-th stage. In this way, the optimization can be formulated as: min \u0398 L(f(X;\u0398),Y), s.t. K\u2211 k=1 CkTk \u2264 B, (6) where f(\u00b7;\u0398) is the deep neural network M parameterized by its weights \u0398, {(X,Y) \u2208 D} is the input-label pair of training samples and L(\u00b7, \u00b7) defines the loss function of the objective. Also, it is noticeable that when we set B = CK and Tmax = TK = B/CK , it decreases to the common training schedule where full model is trained for all training epochs. 4.2 LEVERAGING REDUNDANCIES IN VISION TRANSFORMER: Most previous works (Li et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022a) that focus on budgeted training propose to adjust the length of training epochs to meet the specific demand on the total training cost. Despite its simplicity, these approaches usually suffer from inherent limitations that fail to make use of the model\u2019s characteristics. Nevertheless, the analysis in Sec. 3 motivates us to tackle this task from an alternative perspective, where we focus on leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers along the training process. Specifically, we focus on the number of attention heads, MLP hidden dimension, and the number of visual tokens that have shown great redundancies in Vision Transformers, and propose to reduce their complexity with respect to the training stages. Given a Vision Transformer with M attention heads. Denote C as the MLP hidden dimension and N as the number of visual tokens for each input image. At the first stage of training, only part of the attention heads are activated and the multi-head self-attention in Eq.(3) can be reformulated as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M (1)))W (1) O , (7) where M (1) denotes the number of activated head, and W(1)O \u2208 R m M C\u00d7C contains the m/M part of the input dimension of the original projection matrix WO. The projection matrices Wq,Wk,Wv for queries, keys and values are adjusted in the same way by activating m/M of their output dimensions, i.e., W(1)q ,W (1) k ,W (1) v \u2208 RC\u00d7 m M C . Similarly, for MLP hidden dimension, only C(1)2 of C2 channels are activated in the MLP layers by incorporating a smaller MLP ratio \u03b3. We illustrate the growing process of the MLP ratio in Fig. 5, and the growing of attention heads follow the same recipe. As for the number of visual tokens, we manually drop some of the tokens, and only reserve N (1) to extract the image features. In practice, we set higher prior on the center region of the image, and mainly drop the tokens at the edges of image to avoid severe information loss. As the training progresses, the redundancies in the aforementioned aspects are gradually decreased. Also, model performances will be highly restricted as the model complexity is limited. Therefore, for later stages in the training schedule, we propose to gradually turn on the inactive part of the model, and eventually recover the model capacity by activating the whole model. However, comparing to the activated components that have been trained for a certain of epochs, the inactive part remains the same status as initialization, which is usually randomly sampled from a certain distribution. In this way, simply adding these parts to the training process may result in an imbalance of optimization, and results in degraded model performances. This problem is inevitable when activating the learnable weights for additional attention heads and MLP ratio. Therefore, to avoid the training instability, we propose to make use of the activated parts, and use their weights as the initialization. To avoid having same gradient with copied parameters, we choose to drop the statistical information of the parameters reserved in the optimizer, including their first and second order momenta in the AdamW. Consequently, this results in a diverse gradient direction, and successfully maintain the training stability. 4.3 ADAPTING VISION TRANSFORMER TO BUDGETS: By leveraging the technique we described in Sec. 4.2, the training cost of the models at different stages Ck are controlled according to the fraction of activated components. In this way, given any training budget B, we carefully adjust the duration of each stages Tk and finally satisfies the training constraint \u2211K k=1 CkTk \u2264 B in Eq.(6). Specifically, we employ a family of exponential functions as the prior distribution to sample the duration of each training stage. K random seeds are first sampled from a uniform distribution in the range (0, 1), and then mapped by an exponential function parameterized by a scalar \u03b1: tk = exp (\u03b1sk). The scalar \u03b1 practically reflects the sampling bias towards different stages, i.e., a larger \u03b1 induces larger tks for the later training stages and smaller tks for the early ones. Finally, to fit the total training cost into given training budget, we linearly scale the duration of each stages: Tk = \u230aB/ K\u2211 k=1 bk\u230btk. (8) 5 EXPERIMENTS:  5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: Datasets and models. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet-1K (Deng et al., 2009) dataset for large scale image recognition, which contains 1.28M training examples and 50K validation examples of 1000 classes. We choose three famous families of Vision Transformers, DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), Pyramid Vision Transformer v2 (PVTv2) (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021). DeiT is a classical yet powerful baseline of the isotropic ViTs while PVTv2 and Swin Transformer serve as strong baselines of the ViTs with multiscale feature structures. Implementation details. We follow most of the hyper-parameters of these models including architecture configurations, data augmentations, and stochastic depth rate (Huang et al., 2016). As discussed in Sec. 4.2, we adjust three factors controlling the training cost of the model, including the number of the activated attention heads M , the MLP hidden dimension C, and the proportion of patch tokens N . The detailed specifications are summarized in the appendix. In our method, we choose a moderate \u03b1 = 2.0 in K = 3 training stages. Baselines. In the field of budgeted training, there are two approaches by scheduling learning rate, among which Linear-LR (Li et al., 2020) propose a linear learning rate decay schedule and REXLR (Chen et al., 2022a) design a schedule reflecting the exponential decay. We select these two popular and recent methods as our baselines, which adapt to the given training budget by compressing total epochs in training. For example, let Tmax be the maximum epoch in training at full budget, the two baselines set the epochs to T = 0.5Tmax to meet the 50% budget. Specifically, Linear-LR and REX-LR formulate the learning rate schedules \u03b7linear and \u03b7REX as \u03b7linear(t) = \u03b70(1\u2212 t/T ), \u03b7REX(t) = \u03b70 ( 1\u2212 t/T 0.5 + 0.5(1\u2212 t/T ) ) , (9) where \u03b70 is the initial learning rate, t, T are the current epoch and the total epochs in training. 5.2 BUDGETED TRAINING OF VITS: We report the results of our method and the budgeted training baselines on DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), PVTv2-b2linear (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin-S (Liu et al., 2021). The training cost is the sum of the FLOPs of the model along all the epochs in training. We choose 25%, 50% and 75% for budgeted training. For the learning rate scheduler baselines, we directly discount the number of epochs from 300 to 75, 150, and 225 respectively. For our method, we sample each Tk under the given budget to fit the constraint by Eq.(8). 100% training budget:  75% training budget:  50% training budget:  25% training budget: We summarize our results in Tab. 1, in which our method outperforms two baselines consistently on the three models in terms of Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K validation dataset. For DeiT-S, our method achieves +1.3%, +0.8%, and +0.5% over the baselines on the three training budgets. For The results on PVTv2 and Swin-S models also shows the superiority of our method to the learning rate scheduling techniques. When using full training budget, our method has significant improvements in 1.0% over the original models. Fig. 6 also illustrates the effectiveness of our method. 5.3 ANALYSES: Restricting training epochs. We add another extra constraint that the number of total epochs is limited to 300 as the original model to check the flexibility of our framework. Tab. 2 shows that if the total epochs remain unchanged as the training budget goes low, the training cost is likely to exceed the budget and the performances of models are faded. Therefore, the total epochs should be adjusted according to the budgets in the scheme of multiple stages of different model complexities. Training time. We report the training time of our methods on DeiT-S in Tab. 3. Under 75% FLOPs training budget, our framework saves the training time over 11% in terms of GPU hours without performance drop. Under other budgets, our method also achieves considerable time saving with competitive model performances. Because the total training time is heavily influenced by the CPUs and I/O of the file system, we measure the time of forward and backward passes only to further assess the time saving. It is observed that the saved foward and backward time is more close to the saved training budgets, which implies our method could save more training time in total provided optimized hardware systems. 5.4 ABLATION STUDY: Scalar \u03b1 in Tk sampling controls the growth rate of the exponential function. As shown in Tab. 4, \u03b1 = 5.0 compress the first two stages in less than 20 epochs. When \u03b1 is large enough, the epochs of last training stage TK will dominate all the training epochs, which comes to the case CK = B as Li et al. (2020). If \u03b1 is set to 0, all tks are equal. And when \u03b1 is negative, early tks will become large rather than the later tks, which results in degradation in model performance by -0.7% and -0.9%. Different activated components. As summarized in Tab. 5, we evaluate different types of combination of the activated components on DeiT-S with a fixed schedule [50,100,150]. M , N , C mean adopting the attention heads, tokens and MLP hidden dimensions as the activated components, respectively. The more components partially activated we used in budgeted training, the more training cost we save. We also observe that the number of tokens N is the key to reducing training cost. The number of stage K. To verify the effectiveness of different stage number K in our proposed framework, we choose K = 2, 3, 4 and evaluate the schedules under the similar budgets in the paper. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7, from which we find that K = 3 outperforms K = 2, 4 in all the budgets, thus K = 3 is adopted in our method. 6 CONCLUSION: This paper presents a novel framework for training Vision Transformers at any given budget by reducing the inherent redundancies of the model at the early training stages. We investigate three redundancy factors in Vision Transformers, including attention heads, hidden dimensions in MLP, and visual tokens. Based on these observations, we propose a training strategy to dynamically adjust the activation rate of the model along the training process. Extensive experiments show the effusiveness of our framework with competitive performances on a wide range of training budgets. B RESULTS ON DEIT-B: For DeiT-B, we evaluate our method under the same budgets of 25%, 50% and 75%. As shown in Table 7, there are almost no performance drops of our method as the budgets go smaller whereas the baselines degrade in a large magnitude. Because DeiT-B is a much wider model than DeiT-S, it has more redundancies that can be exploited during training. Nonetheless, larger models require more optimization iterations to converge than the smaller ones, which explains the poor results of the baselines. C MORE ABLATION STUDY: Using less tokens. We provide another baseline of using less tokens by selecting about 25%, 50% and 75% patch tokens in DeiT-S, as shown in Table 9. We observe that only reducing the tokens to save space consumption leads to a sharp performance drop. The implementation of the weights copy. We also investigate the different ways to growing the weight matrices of the projections in the MHSA layer and the MLP layer, as shown in Table 8. We try a total random initialization for the newly activated dimensions, but resulting in a poor performance as listed in the first row. The second row shows that only copying parameters brings about a good performance. Nevertheless, copying the states stored in the optimizer along with the parameters is damaging as the symmetry of the optimization leads to the duplicate weights. The compensation of the replications proposed in (Chen et al., 2015) by multiplying 0.5 in the outgoing weights helps to lift the accuracy to 78.5. However only using this \u00d70.5 technique or adding noise to the grown weights do not help a lot.', 'agent_name': 'RigorousReviewer'}, name='AskAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with ```\n{'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

The paper title is: Budgeted Training for Vision Transformer. INTRODUCTION: Benefited from the large model capacity, Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have demonstrated their predominant performance on various vision tasks, including object detection (Wang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022b), semantic segmentation (Zheng et al., 2021; Strudel et al., 2021), video understanding (Fan et al., 2021; Arnab et al., 2021), etc. However, these improvements come at huge training costs in which the datasets, the model parameters, and the computation complexities have grown enormous in size. For example, ViT-G/14 with Greedy Soup (Wortsman et al., 2022) achieves 90.9% accuracy on the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) benchmark while having 1843M training parameters and being pretrained on a dataset of 3 billion scale. Under this circumstance, computation resource has been becoming an inevitable overhead that prevents common users from training desired vision models. The methodology of designing modern Transformers is finding the best trade-off between the computation costs and the model performances. Besides the widely used factors like the number of the learnable parameters, the floating point operations (FLOPs) and the inference latency, training cost is also an essential resource that involves training schedule (Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2022), memory usage (Pan et al., 2021) and training-stage complexity (Zhang & He, 2020; Gong et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2020). Therefore, the topic of training Transformers efficiently has received broad research interests, especially considering the large-scale data and prolonged schedules in training. Considering that many of the research labs and companies are not able to afford the full training schedule of the best model, one usual solution is to train a better one given a desirable and acceptable total training cost. Previous works that focus on addressing the training efficiency problem mainly learn model-specific schedules based on handcraft designs (Gong et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020; McDanel & Huynh, 2022) or Automated Machine Learning (Li et al., 2022a). However, these approaches either adjust the costs in the training process, or only provide training schedules based on a sparse set of training costs. The inflexibility hinders from generalizing to a pre-defined budget. In this paper, we take a step forward and focus on the problem of budgeted training (Li et al., 2020), i.e., achieving the highest model performance under any given training budget that can be measured by total training time or computation cost. Specifically, we target this problem from the perspective of the inherent properties of Vision Transformers. We show that there exist several types of redundancies during training ViTs, including the feature diversities across different attention heads, the hidden dimensions in the MLP blocks and the number of attended visual tokens. It is shown that these redundancies are correlated with training process, especially they tend to be higher at early stages. This motivates us to dynamically control the activation rate of the model along the training process, where less parameters participate in the early training stages and the full model capacity is activated at late stages. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), we activate 2 attention heads, 51% tokens and 384 MLP hidden dimensions in the first stage, which condenses the model redundancy and keeps a low computation cost, and then the activation rate of the model then gradually increases as training goes on. In this way, the training process becomes more compact, where information loss is greatly avoided and results in limited influence on the model performance. Based on this technique, we can adjust the duration at different level of training stages in order to accommodate to different training budgets. Fig. 1(a) shows our method consistently outperforms the baseline at three different budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the other budgeted training baselines and achieves competitive training cost-performance trade-off on various Vision Transformer models. 2 RELATED WORKS: Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) firstly introduces the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) model into the vision tasks. Wang et al. (2021a; 2022); Liu et al. (2021; 2022) and Zhang et al. (2021a) incorporate the pyramid model architecture with various efficient attention mechanisms for vision. Following the isotropic design, Yuan et al. (2021) leverages overlapped attention, Touvron et al. (2021) benefits from the knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) and Jiang et al. (2021) proposes the token-labeling technique to improve the data efficiency of the Vision Transformer. Redundancies in Transformers have been widely studied in the area of NLP. Michel et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2021b); Voita et al. (2019) prune the redundant attention heads to improve the model efficiency. Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) takes a step further to reuse attention maps in subsequent layers to reduce computations. In vision tasks, the redundancy among visual tokens are of high interest. Wang et al. (2021b) finds that easy samples can be encoded with less tokens. Rao et al. (2021); Xu et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Liang et al. (2022); Song et al. (2021) explore the redundancies in visual tokens by either pruning tokens or introducing sparse computation. Budgeted Training (Li et al., 2020) focuses on training deep neural networks under certain computational resources constraints by linear decaying learning rates. Chen et al. (2022a) proposes an improved schedule named REX in a profile-sampling fashion. Importance sampling methods (Arazo et al., 2021; Andreis et al., 2020) choose the most valuable subset of training data to reduce the training costs with curriculum learning. Pardo et al. (2021) aims to sample informative subset of training data in weakly-supervised object detection. As for the AutoML, Gao et al. (2021) design an automated system to schedule the training tasks according to the budgets. Li et al. (2022a) searches for the optimal training schedule for each budget. Chen et al. (2022b); McDanel & Huynh (2022) can adjust the number of visual tokens during training to adapt to different budgets. 3 REDUNDANCIES DURING TRAINING VITS:  3.1 BACKGROUND OF VISION TRANSFORMER: We first revisit the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). As the variant of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), ViT divides the input H\u00d7W image into a sequence of p\u00d7 p patches in the length of N = HW/p2, and embeds them with linear projections into the Cdimensional subspace. After prepended with a class token and added by a set of position embeddings, the patch embeddings go through subsequent ViT blocks to extract features. The basic building block of ViT consists of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer. The visual tokens are sequentially processed by every block, with LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) and residual connections. Let zl \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the output tokens from the l-th block, the block of ViT is formulated as z\u2032l = zl + MHSA(LN(zl)), zl+1 = z \u2032 l + MLP(LN(z \u2032 l)). (1) The MHSA is introduced to learn different representations from separate attention heads. Let q,k,v \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the query, key and value tokens projected by learnable weights Wq,Wk,Wv \u2208 RC\u00d7C , the attention of the m-th head among M heads is computed as h(m) = softmax ( q(m)k(m)\u22a4/ \u221a d ) v(m), (2) where d = C/m is the dimension of each head. And then the attention heads are concatenated together to produce the final output, followed by a linear projection WO \u2208 RC\u00d7C , written as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M))WO. (3) The MLP is implemented as two fully-connected layers denoted as \u03d51(\u00b7) and \u03d52(\u00b7), with a GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) non-linearity inserted between them. The \u03d51(\u00b7) takes in the tokens with C1 dimension and projects them to a subspace with dimension C2 \u2265 C1. After the activation, these tokens are projected back to C1 dimension as the output of the MLP. We denote the proportion \u03b3 = C2/C1 as the MLP ratio in the remaining paper. In this section we opt a representative ViT architecture, DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), to analyze the redundancies in ViT training. The same conclusions can be generalized to other Transformer architectures. 3.2 REDUNDANCIES IN ATTENTION HEADS: There are six heads in each MHSA layer of DeiT-S, where each head holds a 64-dim representation to compute self-attention. A question will be raised: are all the heads important? In the natural language processing (NLP), it has been observed that zeroing out the representations of some heads or even keeping only one head active is enough to preserve the model performance at the test time (Michel et al., 2019). Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) finds that the attention maps of heads share high similarities between consecutive layers in both vision and NLP tasks. However, few studies inspect this question from the perspective of training. We compare the CKA similarity between every pair of heads to assess their redundancies. CKA is short for centered kernel alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019; Raghu et al., 2021; Cortes et al., 2012), which is a popular metric to quantize the similarity between the representation of each head. CKA takes two activation matrices X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p1 ,Y \u2208 Rm\u00d7p2 in the networks as input, and computes the Gram matrices L = XX\u22a4,K = YY\u22a4. By centering the Gram matrices by H = I \u2212 1m11 \u22a4, K\u0304 = HKH, L\u0304 = HLH, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2007) and the CKA are computed as CKA(K,L) = HSIC(K,L)\u221a HSIC(K,K)HSIC(L,L) , HSIC(K,L) = vec(K\u0304) \u00b7 vec(L\u0304) (m\u2212 1)2 . (4) We compute the CKA(h(i)l ,h (j) l ) for each pair of the i-th and the j-th head in the l-th block of the DeiT-S model on ImageNet validation set, where h(i)l is the output feature of every separate head attention in Eq.(2) before the concatenation and projection in Eq.(3). As shown in Fig. 2(a), there are significant descents of these similarities in some multi-head attention blocks. For example, the CKA score in block04 first grows over 0.6 and rapidly decreases to nearly zero as training goes on. To show this trend more clearly, Fig. 2(b) displays the dynamics of similarity matrices at different epochs. From these observations, there exist considerable redundancies between the attention heads and the redundancies are decreasing during the training, which enlightens us to activate fewer heads during the early stage of the training. 3.3 REDUNDANCIES IN MLP HIDDEN DIMENSIONS: The dimension expansion and contraction design in the MLP layer of ViTs extracts features by projecting and activating them in a higher-dimensional space, which brings in a great deal of redundancies in features. The searched optimal architectures in ViT-Slim (Chavan et al., 2022) also reveal this type of redundancy in which lots of the hidden dimensions in MLP layers are removed. In terms of training, we leverage the principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze these redundancies among the features in the expanded dimension space projected by \u03d51(\u00b7) in the MLP block. For each token \u03d51(x) \u2208 RN\u00d7C2 in the MLP block of DeiTS, we compute its number of principal components that hold a given proportion of the explained variance. This criterion has been also adopted in pruning redundant neurons in deep networks (Casper et al., 2021). We choose the 99% threshold to measure the alternation of the principal components distribution during training. We plot the numbers of principal components w.r.t. the training epochs in Fig. 3. It is observed that the numbers of principal components are growing as the training epoch increases in the shallow and middle blocks. This phenomenon indicates that in the early training stages, only a few components can hold the most explained variances, i.e., support the projected space. Therefore the redundancies in the early stages of training are in high degree, especially in the shallow blocks. For the deep blocks there also exist the trends of increase of the numbers of components, however they are relatively noisy so we omit them in the figure. This observation demonstrates that the features are highly linearly dependent in early epochs, lacking diversities among dimensions. As the training goes on, the redundan- cies are gradually declining, achieving a final state with much fewer redundancies. It suggests that a large MLP ratio \u03b3 with high hidden dimensions at the early training stage be excessive and a growing \u03b3 from a smaller value would be beneficial to alleviating this redundancy. 3.4 REDUNDANCIES IN VISUAL TOKENS: The spatial redundancies in the visual tokens have been widely studied. Many efficient Vision Transformers have sought to eliminate the redundancies during inference time (Wang et al., 2021b; Rao et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022). We follow this line of research to investigate the redundancies among tokens during the training procedure, leveraging the visualization of the class attention. The class attention score is defined as the attention between the class token qcls and other patch tokens k, i.e., Acls = softmax(qclsk\u22a4/ \u221a d). If we view these attention scores as a distribution, the patch tokens with high scores contribute more to the class token, which indicates the informative tokens of the important image patches. As illustrated in Fig. 4, we observe that the patch tokens with higher attention scores first emerge in a small area of the image. And then more patches on the target object begin to get a higher class attention score during training, indicating there are some redundancies in the patch tokens at the early stage of training. This phenomenon exists in some shallow blocks while the class attention in the deep blocks displays a nearly uniform distribution among all visual tokens. Since the effective receptive field of ViTs grow very quickly as the block goes deeper (d\u2019Ascoli et al., 2021; Raghu et al., 2021), the class attention degenerates to a global-pooling operation to aggregate all the tokens. This trend appeals to us to reduce the number of visual tokens in early epochs. 4 BUDGETED TRAINING FOR VISION TRANSFORMER: Different from most of the previous works that improves training efficiency based on a fixed schedule, our target is to propose a flexible training framework that can easily adapt to a wide range of training budgets while maintaining competitive performances. In the following, we would first define the problem of budgeted training and then show how we solve the problem by leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers. 4.1 BUDGETED TRAINING: The total cost of training a deep neural network M can be defined as the accumulation of the model\u2019s computation cost over all the training steps. The budgeted training problem is to minimize the objective loss such that the total computation costs C(M) of training are under the given budget constraint B, min \u0398 L(M;D), s.t. C(M) = \u222b Tmax 0 C(T ;M) dT \u2264 B, (5) where C(T ;M) is the computation cost of the model M at the T -th training epoch. Nevertheless, considering the computational intractability of the integration and the potential additional inefficiency when frequently switching the training cost C(T ;M) at different epochs, we simplify the optimization problem by dividing the total training process into several stages and hypothesize the training cost remains unchanged in each stage. Specifically, we divide a training procedure with Tmax epochs into K stages satisfying \u2211K k=1 Tk = Tmax, and we denote Ck as the training cost of model M at the k-th stage. In this way, the optimization can be formulated as: min \u0398 L(f(X;\u0398),Y), s.t. K\u2211 k=1 CkTk \u2264 B, (6) where f(\u00b7;\u0398) is the deep neural network M parameterized by its weights \u0398, {(X,Y) \u2208 D} is the input-label pair of training samples and L(\u00b7, \u00b7) defines the loss function of the objective. Also, it is noticeable that when we set B = CK and Tmax = TK = B/CK , it decreases to the common training schedule where full model is trained for all training epochs. 4.2 LEVERAGING REDUNDANCIES IN VISION TRANSFORMER: Most previous works (Li et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022a) that focus on budgeted training propose to adjust the length of training epochs to meet the specific demand on the total training cost. Despite its simplicity, these approaches usually suffer from inherent limitations that fail to make use of the model\u2019s characteristics. Nevertheless, the analysis in Sec. 3 motivates us to tackle this task from an alternative perspective, where we focus on leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers along the training process. Specifically, we focus on the number of attention heads, MLP hidden dimension, and the number of visual tokens that have shown great redundancies in Vision Transformers, and propose to reduce their complexity with respect to the training stages. Given a Vision Transformer with M attention heads. Denote C as the MLP hidden dimension and N as the number of visual tokens for each input image. At the first stage of training, only part of the attention heads are activated and the multi-head self-attention in Eq.(3) can be reformulated as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M (1)))W (1) O , (7) where M (1) denotes the number of activated head, and W(1)O \u2208 R m M C\u00d7C contains the m/M part of the input dimension of the original projection matrix WO. The projection matrices Wq,Wk,Wv for queries, keys and values are adjusted in the same way by activating m/M of their output dimensions, i.e., W(1)q ,W (1) k ,W (1) v \u2208 RC\u00d7 m M C . Similarly, for MLP hidden dimension, only C(1)2 of C2 channels are activated in the MLP layers by incorporating a smaller MLP ratio \u03b3. We illustrate the growing process of the MLP ratio in Fig. 5, and the growing of attention heads follow the same recipe. As for the number of visual tokens, we manually drop some of the tokens, and only reserve N (1) to extract the image features. In practice, we set higher prior on the center region of the image, and mainly drop the tokens at the edges of image to avoid severe information loss. As the training progresses, the redundancies in the aforementioned aspects are gradually decreased. Also, model performances will be highly restricted as the model complexity is limited. Therefore, for later stages in the training schedule, we propose to gradually turn on the inactive part of the model, and eventually recover the model capacity by activating the whole model. However, comparing to the activated components that have been trained for a certain of epochs, the inactive part remains the same status as initialization, which is usually randomly sampled from a certain distribution. In this way, simply adding these parts to the training process may result in an imbalance of optimization, and results in degraded model performances. This problem is inevitable when activating the learnable weights for additional attention heads and MLP ratio. Therefore, to avoid the training instability, we propose to make use of the activated parts, and use their weights as the initialization. To avoid having same gradient with copied parameters, we choose to drop the statistical information of the parameters reserved in the optimizer, including their first and second order momenta in the AdamW. Consequently, this results in a diverse gradient direction, and successfully maintain the training stability. 4.3 ADAPTING VISION TRANSFORMER TO BUDGETS: By leveraging the technique we described in Sec. 4.2, the training cost of the models at different stages Ck are controlled according to the fraction of activated components. In this way, given any training budget B, we carefully adjust the duration of each stages Tk and finally satisfies the training constraint \u2211K k=1 CkTk \u2264 B in Eq.(6). Specifically, we employ a family of exponential functions as the prior distribution to sample the duration of each training stage. K random seeds are first sampled from a uniform distribution in the range (0, 1), and then mapped by an exponential function parameterized by a scalar \u03b1: tk = exp (\u03b1sk). The scalar \u03b1 practically reflects the sampling bias towards different stages, i.e., a larger \u03b1 induces larger tks for the later training stages and smaller tks for the early ones. Finally, to fit the total training cost into given training budget, we linearly scale the duration of each stages: Tk = \u230aB/ K\u2211 k=1 bk\u230btk. (8) 5 EXPERIMENTS:  5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: Datasets and models. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet-1K (Deng et al., 2009) dataset for large scale image recognition, which contains 1.28M training examples and 50K validation examples of 1000 classes. We choose three famous families of Vision Transformers, DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), Pyramid Vision Transformer v2 (PVTv2) (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021). DeiT is a classical yet powerful baseline of the isotropic ViTs while PVTv2 and Swin Transformer serve as strong baselines of the ViTs with multiscale feature structures. Implementation details. We follow most of the hyper-parameters of these models including architecture configurations, data augmentations, and stochastic depth rate (Huang et al., 2016). As discussed in Sec. 4.2, we adjust three factors controlling the training cost of the model, including the number of the activated attention heads M , the MLP hidden dimension C, and the proportion of patch tokens N . The detailed specifications are summarized in the appendix. In our method, we choose a moderate \u03b1 = 2.0 in K = 3 training stages. Baselines. In the field of budgeted training, there are two approaches by scheduling learning rate, among which Linear-LR (Li et al., 2020) propose a linear learning rate decay schedule and REXLR (Chen et al., 2022a) design a schedule reflecting the exponential decay. We select these two popular and recent methods as our baselines, which adapt to the given training budget by compressing total epochs in training. For example, let Tmax be the maximum epoch in training at full budget, the two baselines set the epochs to T = 0.5Tmax to meet the 50% budget. Specifically, Linear-LR and REX-LR formulate the learning rate schedules \u03b7linear and \u03b7REX as \u03b7linear(t) = \u03b70(1\u2212 t/T ), \u03b7REX(t) = \u03b70 ( 1\u2212 t/T 0.5 + 0.5(1\u2212 t/T ) ) , (9) where \u03b70 is the initial learning rate, t, T are the current epoch and the total epochs in training. 5.2 BUDGETED TRAINING OF VITS: We report the results of our method and the budgeted training baselines on DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), PVTv2-b2linear (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin-S (Liu et al., 2021). The training cost is the sum of the FLOPs of the model along all the epochs in training. We choose 25%, 50% and 75% for budgeted training. For the learning rate scheduler baselines, we directly discount the number of epochs from 300 to 75, 150, and 225 respectively. For our method, we sample each Tk under the given budget to fit the constraint by Eq.(8). 100% training budget:  75% training budget:  50% training budget:  25% training budget: We summarize our results in Tab. 1, in which our method outperforms two baselines consistently on the three models in terms of Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K validation dataset. For DeiT-S, our method achieves +1.3%, +0.8%, and +0.5% over the baselines on the three training budgets. For The results on PVTv2 and Swin-S models also shows the superiority of our method to the learning rate scheduling techniques. When using full training budget, our method has significant improvements in 1.0% over the original models. Fig. 6 also illustrates the effectiveness of our method. 5.3 ANALYSES: Restricting training epochs. We add another extra constraint that the number of total epochs is limited to 300 as the original model to check the flexibility of our framework. Tab. 2 shows that if the total epochs remain unchanged as the training budget goes low, the training cost is likely to exceed the budget and the performances of models are faded. Therefore, the total epochs should be adjusted according to the budgets in the scheme of multiple stages of different model complexities. Training time. We report the training time of our methods on DeiT-S in Tab. 3. Under 75% FLOPs training budget, our framework saves the training time over 11% in terms of GPU hours without performance drop. Under other budgets, our method also achieves considerable time saving with competitive model performances. Because the total training time is heavily influenced by the CPUs and I/O of the file system, we measure the time of forward and backward passes only to further assess the time saving. It is observed that the saved foward and backward time is more close to the saved training budgets, which implies our method could save more training time in total provided optimized hardware systems. 5.4 ABLATION STUDY: Scalar \u03b1 in Tk sampling controls the growth rate of the exponential function. As shown in Tab. 4, \u03b1 = 5.0 compress the first two stages in less than 20 epochs. When \u03b1 is large enough, the epochs of last training stage TK will dominate all the training epochs, which comes to the case CK = B as Li et al. (2020). If \u03b1 is set to 0, all tks are equal. And when \u03b1 is negative, early tks will become large rather than the later tks, which results in degradation in model performance by -0.7% and -0.9%. Different activated components. As summarized in Tab. 5, we evaluate different types of combination of the activated components on DeiT-S with a fixed schedule [50,100,150]. M , N , C mean adopting the attention heads, tokens and MLP hidden dimensions as the activated components, respectively. The more components partially activated we used in budgeted training, the more training cost we save. We also observe that the number of tokens N is the key to reducing training cost. The number of stage K. To verify the effectiveness of different stage number K in our proposed framework, we choose K = 2, 3, 4 and evaluate the schedules under the similar budgets in the paper. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7, from which we find that K = 3 outperforms K = 2, 4 in all the budgets, thus K = 3 is adopted in our method. 6 CONCLUSION: This paper presents a novel framework for training Vision Transformers at any given budget by reducing the inherent redundancies of the model at the early training stages. We investigate three redundancy factors in Vision Transformers, including attention heads, hidden dimensions in MLP, and visual tokens. Based on these observations, we propose a training strategy to dynamically adjust the activation rate of the model along the training process. Extensive experiments show the effusiveness of our framework with competitive performances on a wide range of training budgets. B RESULTS ON DEIT-B: For DeiT-B, we evaluate our method under the same budgets of 25%, 50% and 75%. As shown in Table 7, there are almost no performance drops of our method as the budgets go smaller whereas the baselines degrade in a large magnitude. Because DeiT-B is a much wider model than DeiT-S, it has more redundancies that can be exploited during training. Nonetheless, larger models require more optimization iterations to converge than the smaller ones, which explains the poor results of the baselines. C MORE ABLATION STUDY: Using less tokens. We provide another baseline of using less tokens by selecting about 25%, 50% and 75% patch tokens in DeiT-S, as shown in Table 9. We observe that only reducing the tokens to save space consumption leads to a sharp performance drop. The implementation of the weights copy. We also investigate the different ways to growing the weight matrices of the projections in the MHSA layer and the MLP layer, as shown in Table 8. We try a total random initialization for the newly activated dimensions, but resulting in a poor performance as listed in the first row. The second row shows that only copying parameters brings about a good performance. Nevertheless, copying the states stored in the optimizer along with the parameters is damaging as the symmetry of the optimization leads to the duplicate weights. The compensation of the replications proposed in (Chen et al., 2015) by multiplying 0.5 in the outgoing weights helps to lift the accuracy to 78.5. However only using this \u00d70.5 technique or adding noise to the grown weights do not help a lot.', 'agent_name': 'RigorousReviewer'}`\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

The paper title is: Budgeted Training for Vision Transformer. INTRODUCTION: Benefited from the large model capacity, Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have demonstrated their predominant performance on various vision tasks, including object detection (Wang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022b), semantic segmentation (Zheng et al., 2021; Strudel et al., 2021), video understanding (Fan et al., 2021; Arnab et al., 2021), etc. However, these improvements come at huge training costs in which the datasets, the model parameters, and the computation complexities have grown enormous in size. For example, ViT-G/14 with Greedy Soup (Wortsman et al., 2022) achieves 90.9% accuracy on the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) benchmark while having 1843M training parameters and being pretrained on a dataset of 3 billion scale. Under this circumstance, computation resource has been becoming an inevitable overhead that prevents common users from training desired vision models. The methodology of designing modern Transformers is finding the best trade-off between the computation costs and the model performances. Besides the widely used factors like the number of the learnable parameters, the floating point operations (FLOPs) and the inference latency, training cost is also an essential resource that involves training schedule (Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2022), memory usage (Pan et al., 2021) and training-stage complexity (Zhang & He, 2020; Gong et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2020). Therefore, the topic of training Transformers efficiently has received broad research interests, especially considering the large-scale data and prolonged schedules in training. Considering that many of the research labs and companies are not able to afford the full training schedule of the best model, one usual solution is to train a better one given a desirable and acceptable total training cost. Previous works that focus on addressing the training efficiency problem mainly learn model-specific schedules based on handcraft designs (Gong et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020; McDanel & Huynh, 2022) or Automated Machine Learning (Li et al., 2022a). However, these approaches either adjust the costs in the training process, or only provide training schedules based on a sparse set of training costs. The inflexibility hinders from generalizing to a pre-defined budget. In this paper, we take a step forward and focus on the problem of budgeted training (Li et al., 2020), i.e., achieving the highest model performance under any given training budget that can be measured by total training time or computation cost. Specifically, we target this problem from the perspective of the inherent properties of Vision Transformers. We show that there exist several types of redundancies during training ViTs, including the feature diversities across different attention heads, the hidden dimensions in the MLP blocks and the number of attended visual tokens. It is shown that these redundancies are correlated with training process, especially they tend to be higher at early stages. This motivates us to dynamically control the activation rate of the model along the training process, where less parameters participate in the early training stages and the full model capacity is activated at late stages. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), we activate 2 attention heads, 51% tokens and 384 MLP hidden dimensions in the first stage, which condenses the model redundancy and keeps a low computation cost, and then the activation rate of the model then gradually increases as training goes on. In this way, the training process becomes more compact, where information loss is greatly avoided and results in limited influence on the model performance. Based on this technique, we can adjust the duration at different level of training stages in order to accommodate to different training budgets. Fig. 1(a) shows our method consistently outperforms the baseline at three different budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the other budgeted training baselines and achieves competitive training cost-performance trade-off on various Vision Transformer models. 2 RELATED WORKS: Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) firstly introduces the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) model into the vision tasks. Wang et al. (2021a; 2022); Liu et al. (2021; 2022) and Zhang et al. (2021a) incorporate the pyramid model architecture with various efficient attention mechanisms for vision. Following the isotropic design, Yuan et al. (2021) leverages overlapped attention, Touvron et al. (2021) benefits from the knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) and Jiang et al. (2021) proposes the token-labeling technique to improve the data efficiency of the Vision Transformer. Redundancies in Transformers have been widely studied in the area of NLP. Michel et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2021b); Voita et al. (2019) prune the redundant attention heads to improve the model efficiency. Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) takes a step further to reuse attention maps in subsequent layers to reduce computations. In vision tasks, the redundancy among visual tokens are of high interest. Wang et al. (2021b) finds that easy samples can be encoded with less tokens. Rao et al. (2021); Xu et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Liang et al. (2022); Song et al. (2021) explore the redundancies in visual tokens by either pruning tokens or introducing sparse computation. Budgeted Training (Li et al., 2020) focuses on training deep neural networks under certain computational resources constraints by linear decaying learning rates. Chen et al. (2022a) proposes an improved schedule named REX in a profile-sampling fashion. Importance sampling methods (Arazo et al., 2021; Andreis et al., 2020) choose the most valuable subset of training data to reduce the training costs with curriculum learning. Pardo et al. (2021) aims to sample informative subset of training data in weakly-supervised object detection. As for the AutoML, Gao et al. (2021) design an automated system to schedule the training tasks according to the budgets. Li et al. (2022a) searches for the optimal training schedule for each budget. Chen et al. (2022b); McDanel & Huynh (2022) can adjust the number of visual tokens during training to adapt to different budgets. 3 REDUNDANCIES DURING TRAINING VITS:  3.1 BACKGROUND OF VISION TRANSFORMER: We first revisit the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). As the variant of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), ViT divides the input H\u00d7W image into a sequence of p\u00d7 p patches in the length of N = HW/p2, and embeds them with linear projections into the Cdimensional subspace. After prepended with a class token and added by a set of position embeddings, the patch embeddings go through subsequent ViT blocks to extract features. The basic building block of ViT consists of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer. The visual tokens are sequentially processed by every block, with LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) and residual connections. Let zl \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the output tokens from the l-th block, the block of ViT is formulated as z\u2032l = zl + MHSA(LN(zl)), zl+1 = z \u2032 l + MLP(LN(z \u2032 l)). (1) The MHSA is introduced to learn different representations from separate attention heads. Let q,k,v \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the query, key and value tokens projected by learnable weights Wq,Wk,Wv \u2208 RC\u00d7C , the attention of the m-th head among M heads is computed as h(m) = softmax ( q(m)k(m)\u22a4/ \u221a d ) v(m), (2) where d = C/m is the dimension of each head. And then the attention heads are concatenated together to produce the final output, followed by a linear projection WO \u2208 RC\u00d7C , written as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M))WO. (3) The MLP is implemented as two fully-connected layers denoted as \u03d51(\u00b7) and \u03d52(\u00b7), with a GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) non-linearity inserted between them. The \u03d51(\u00b7) takes in the tokens with C1 dimension and projects them to a subspace with dimension C2 \u2265 C1. After the activation, these tokens are projected back to C1 dimension as the output of the MLP. We denote the proportion \u03b3 = C2/C1 as the MLP ratio in the remaining paper. In this section we opt a representative ViT architecture, DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), to analyze the redundancies in ViT training. The same conclusions can be generalized to other Transformer architectures. 3.2 REDUNDANCIES IN ATTENTION HEADS: There are six heads in each MHSA layer of DeiT-S, where each head holds a 64-dim representation to compute self-attention. A question will be raised: are all the heads important? In the natural language processing (NLP), it has been observed that zeroing out the representations of some heads or even keeping only one head active is enough to preserve the model performance at the test time (Michel et al., 2019). Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) finds that the attention maps of heads share high similarities between consecutive layers in both vision and NLP tasks. However, few studies inspect this question from the perspective of training. We compare the CKA similarity between every pair of heads to assess their redundancies. CKA is short for centered kernel alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019; Raghu et al., 2021; Cortes et al., 2012), which is a popular metric to quantize the similarity between the representation of each head. CKA takes two activation matrices X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p1 ,Y \u2208 Rm\u00d7p2 in the networks as input, and computes the Gram matrices L = XX\u22a4,K = YY\u22a4. By centering the Gram matrices by H = I \u2212 1m11 \u22a4, K\u0304 = HKH, L\u0304 = HLH, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2007) and the CKA are computed as CKA(K,L) = HSIC(K,L)\u221a HSIC(K,K)HSIC(L,L) , HSIC(K,L) = vec(K\u0304) \u00b7 vec(L\u0304) (m\u2212 1)2 . (4) We compute the CKA(h(i)l ,h (j) l ) for each pair of the i-th and the j-th head in the l-th block of the DeiT-S model on ImageNet validation set, where h(i)l is the output feature of every separate head attention in Eq.(2) before the concatenation and projection in Eq.(3). As shown in Fig. 2(a), there are significant descents of these similarities in some multi-head attention blocks. For example, the CKA score in block04 first grows over 0.6 and rapidly decreases to nearly zero as training goes on. To show this trend more clearly, Fig. 2(b) displays the dynamics of similarity matrices at different epochs. From these observations, there exist considerable redundancies between the attention heads and the redundancies are decreasing during the training, which enlightens us to activate fewer heads during the early stage of the training. 3.3 REDUNDANCIES IN MLP HIDDEN DIMENSIONS: The dimension expansion and contraction design in the MLP layer of ViTs extracts features by projecting and activating them in a higher-dimensional space, which brings in a great deal of redundancies in features. The searched optimal architectures in ViT-Slim (Chavan et al., 2022) also reveal this type of redundancy in which lots of the hidden dimensions in MLP layers are removed. In terms of training, we leverage the principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze these redundancies among the features in the expanded dimension space projected by \u03d51(\u00b7) in the MLP block. For each token \u03d51(x) \u2208 RN\u00d7C2 in the MLP block of DeiTS, we compute its number of principal components that hold a given proportion of the explained variance. This criterion has been also adopted in pruning redundant neurons in deep networks (Casper et al., 2021). We choose the 99% threshold to measure the alternation of the principal components distribution during training. We plot the numbers of principal components w.r.t. the training epochs in Fig. 3. It is observed that the numbers of principal components are growing as the training epoch increases in the shallow and middle blocks. This phenomenon indicates that in the early training stages, only a few components can hold the most explained variances, i.e., support the projected space. Therefore the redundancies in the early stages of training are in high degree, especially in the shallow blocks. For the deep blocks there also exist the trends of increase of the numbers of components, however they are relatively noisy so we omit them in the figure. This observation demonstrates that the features are highly linearly dependent in early epochs, lacking diversities among dimensions. As the training goes on, the redundan- cies are gradually declining, achieving a final state with much fewer redundancies. It suggests that a large MLP ratio \u03b3 with high hidden dimensions at the early training stage be excessive and a growing \u03b3 from a smaller value would be beneficial to alleviating this redundancy. 3.4 REDUNDANCIES IN VISUAL TOKENS: The spatial redundancies in the visual tokens have been widely studied. Many efficient Vision Transformers have sought to eliminate the redundancies during inference time (Wang et al., 2021b; Rao et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022). We follow this line of research to investigate the redundancies among tokens during the training procedure, leveraging the visualization of the class attention. The class attention score is defined as the attention between the class token qcls and other patch tokens k, i.e., Acls = softmax(qclsk\u22a4/ \u221a d). If we view these attention scores as a distribution, the patch tokens with high scores contribute more to the class token, which indicates the informative tokens of the important image patches. As illustrated in Fig. 4, we observe that the patch tokens with higher attention scores first emerge in a small area of the image. And then more patches on the target object begin to get a higher class attention score during training, indicating there are some redundancies in the patch tokens at the early stage of training. This phenomenon exists in some shallow blocks while the class attention in the deep blocks displays a nearly uniform distribution among all visual tokens. Since the effective receptive field of ViTs grow very quickly as the block goes deeper (d\u2019Ascoli, 2021; Raghu et al., 2021), the class attention degenerates to a global-pooling operation to aggregate all the tokens. This trend appeals to us to reduce the number of visual tokens in early epochs. 4 BUDGETED TRAINING FOR VISION TRANSFORMER: Different from most of the previous works that improves training efficiency based on a fixed schedule, our target is to propose a flexible training framework that can easily adapt to a wide range of training budgets while maintaining competitive performances. In the following, we would first define the problem of budgeted training and then show how we solve the problem by leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers. 4.1 BUDGETED TRAINING: The total cost of training a deep neural network M can be defined as the accumulation of the model\u2019s computation cost over all the training steps. The budgeted training problem is to minimize the objective loss such that the total computation costs C(M) of training are under the given budget constraint B, min \u0398 L(M;D), s.t. C(M) = \u222b Tmax 0 C(T ;M) dT \u2264 B, (5) where C(T ;M) is the computation cost of the model M at the T -th training epoch. Nevertheless, considering the computational intractability of the integration and the potential additional inefficiency when frequently switching the training cost C(T ;M) at different epochs, we simplify the optimization problem by dividing the total training process into several stages and hypothesize the training cost remains unchanged in each stage. Specifically, we divide a training procedure with Tmax epochs into K stages satisfying \u2211K k=1 Tk = Tmax, and we denote Ck as the training cost of model M at the k-th stage. In this way, the optimization can be formulated as: min \u0398 L(f(X;\u0398),Y), s.t. K\u2211 k=1 CkTk \u2264 B, (6) where f(\u00b7;\u0398) is the deep neural network M parameterized by its weights \u0398, {(X,Y) \u2208 D} is the input-label pair of training samples and L(\u00b7, \u00b7) defines the loss function of the objective. Also, it is noticeable that when we set B = CK and Tmax = TK = B/CK , it decreases to the common training schedule where full model is trained for all training epochs. 4.2 LEVERAGING REDUNDANCIES IN VISION TRANSFORMER: Most previous works (Li et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022a) that focus on budgeted training propose to adjust the length of training epochs to meet the specific demand on the total training cost. Despite its simplicity, these approaches usually suffer from inherent limitations that fail to make use of the model\u2019s characteristics. Nevertheless, the analysis in Sec. 3 motivates us to tackle this task from an alternative perspective, where we focus on leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers along the training process. Specifically, we focus on the number of attention heads, MLP hidden dimension, and the number of visual tokens that have shown great redundancies in Vision Transformers, and propose to reduce their complexity with respect to the training stages. Given a Vision Transformer with M attention heads. Denote C as the MLP hidden dimension and N as the number of visual tokens for each input image. At the first stage of training, only part of the attention heads are activated and the multi-head self-attention in Eq.(3) can be reformulated as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M (1)))W (1) O , (7) where M (1) denotes the number of activated head, and W(1)O \u2208 R m M C\u00d7C contains the m/M part of the input dimension of the original projection matrix WO. The projection matrices Wq,Wk,Wv for queries, keys and values are adjusted in the same way by activating m/M of their output dimensions, i.e., W(1)q ,W (1) k ,W (1) v \u2208 RC\u00d7 m M C . Similarly, for MLP hidden dimension, only C(1)2 of C2 channels are activated in the MLP layers by incorporating a smaller MLP ratio \u03b3. We illustrate the growing process of the MLP ratio in Fig. 5, and the growing of attention heads follow the same recipe. As for the number of visual tokens, we manually drop some of the tokens, and only reserve N (1) to extract the image features. In practice, we set higher prior on the center region of the image, and mainly drop the tokens at the edges of image to avoid severe information loss. As the training progresses, the redundancies in the aforementioned aspects are gradually decreased. Also, model performances will be highly restricted as the model complexity is limited. Therefore, for later stages in the training schedule, we propose to gradually turn on the inactive part of the model, and eventually recover the model capacity by activating the whole model. However, comparing to the activated components that have been trained for a certain of epochs, the inactive part remains the same status as initialization, which is usually randomly sampled from a certain distribution. In this way, simply adding these parts to the training process may result in an imbalance of optimization, and results in degraded model performances. This problem is inevitable when activating the learnable weights for additional attention heads and MLP ratio. Therefore, to avoid the training instability, we propose to make use of the activated parts, and use their weights as the initialization. To avoid having same gradient with copied parameters, we choose to drop the statistical information of the parameters reserved in the optimizer, including their first and second order momenta in the AdamW. Consequently, this results in a diverse gradient direction, and successfully maintain the training stability. 4.3 ADAPTING VISION TRANSFORMER TO BUDGETS: By leveraging the technique we described in Sec. 4.2, the training cost of the models at different stages Ck are controlled according to the fraction of activated components. In this way, given any training budget B, we carefully adjust the duration of each stages Tk and finally satisfies the training constraint \u2211K k=1 CkTk \u2264 B in Eq.(6). Specifically, we employ a family of exponential functions as the prior distribution to sample the duration of each training stage. K random seeds are first sampled from a uniform distribution in the range (0, 1), and then mapped by an exponential function parameterized by a scalar \u03b1: tk = exp (\u03b1sk). The scalar \u03b1 practically reflects the sampling bias towards different stages, i.e., a larger \u03b1 induces larger tks for the later training stages and smaller tks for the early ones. Finally, to fit the total training cost into given training budget, we linearly scale the duration of each stages: Tk = \u230aB/ K\u2211 k=1 bk\u230btk. (8) 5 EXPERIMENTS:  5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: Datasets and models. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet-1K (Deng et al., 2009) dataset for large scale image recognition, which contains 1.28M training examples and 50K validation examples of 1000 classes. We choose three famous families of Vision Transformers, DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), Pyramid Vision Transformer v2 (PVTv2) (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021). DeiT is a classical yet powerful baseline of the isotropic ViTs while PVTv2 and Swin Transformer serve as strong baselines of the ViTs with multiscale feature structures. Implementation details. We follow most of the hyper-parameters of these models including architecture configurations, data augmentations, and stochastic depth rate (Huang et al., 2016). As discussed in Sec. 4.2, we adjust three factors controlling the training cost of the model, including the number of the activated attention heads M , the MLP hidden dimension C, and the proportion of patch tokens N . The detailed specifications are summarized in the appendix. In our method, we choose a moderate \u03b1 = 2.0 in K = 3 training stages. Baselines. In the field of budgeted training, there are two approaches by scheduling learning rate, among which Linear-LR (Li et al., 2020) propose a linear learning rate decay schedule and REXLR (Chen et al., 2022a) design a schedule reflecting the exponential decay. We select these two popular and recent methods as our baselines, which adapt to the given training budget by compressing total epochs in training. For example, let Tmax be the maximum epoch in training at full budget, the two baselines set the epochs to T = 0.5Tmax to meet the 50% budget. Specifically, Linear-LR and REX-LR formulate the learning rate schedules \u03b7linear and \u03b7REX as \u03b7linear(t) = \u03b70(1\u2212 t/T ), \u03b7REX(t) = \u03b70 ( 1\u2212 t/T 0.5 + 0.5(1\u2212 t/T ) ) , (9) where \u03b70 is the initial learning rate, t, T are the current epoch and the total epochs in training. 5.2 BUDGETED TRAINING OF VITS: We report the results of our method and the budgeted training baselines on DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), PVTv2-b2linear (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin-S (Liu et al., 2021). The training cost is the sum of the FLOPs of the model along all the epochs in training. We choose 25%, 50% and 75% for budgeted training. For the learning rate scheduler baselines, we directly discount the number of epochs from 300 to 75, 150, and 225 respectively. For our method, we sample each Tk under the given budget to fit the constraint by Eq.(8). 100% training budget:  75% training budget:  50% training budget:  25% training budget: We summarize our results in Tab. 1, in which our method outperforms two baselines consistently on the three models in terms of Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K validation dataset. For DeiT-S, our method achieves +1.3%, +0.8%, and +0.5% over the baselines on the three training budgets. For The results on PVTv2 and Swin-S models also shows the superiority of our method to the learning rate scheduling techniques. When using full training budget, our method has significant improvements in 1.0% over the original models. Fig. 6 also illustrates the effectiveness of our method. 5.3 ANALYSES: Restricting training epochs. We add another extra constraint that the number of total epochs is limited to 300 as the original model to check the flexibility of our framework. Tab. 2 shows that if the total epochs remain unchanged as the training budget goes low, the training cost is likely to exceed the budget and the performances of models are faded. Therefore, the total epochs should be adjusted according to the budgets in the scheme of multiple stages of different model complexities. Training time. We report the training time of our methods on DeiT-S in Tab. 3. Under 75% FLOPs training budget, our framework saves the training time over 11% in terms of GPU hours without performance drop. Under other budgets, our method also achieves considerable time saving with competitive model performances. Because the total training time is heavily influenced by the CPUs and I/O of the file system, we measure the time of forward and backward passes only to further assess the time saving. It is observed that the saved foward and backward time is more close to the saved training budgets, which implies our method could save more training time in total provided optimized hardware systems. 5.4 ABLATION STUDY: Scalar \u03b1 in Tk sampling controls the growth rate of the exponential function. As shown in Tab. 4, \u03b1 = 5.0 compress the first two stages in less than 20 epochs. When \u03b1 is large enough, the epochs of last training stage TK will dominate all the training epochs, which comes to the case CK = B as Li et al. (2020). If \u03b1 is set to 0, all tks are equal. And when \u03b1 is negative, early tks will become large rather than the later tks, which results in degradation in model performance by -0.7% and -0.9%. Different activated components. As summarized in Tab. 5, we evaluate different types of combination of the activated components on DeiT-S with a fixed schedule [50,100,150]. M , N , C mean adopting the attention heads, tokens and MLP hidden dimensions as the activated components, respectively. The more components partially activated we used in budgeted training, the more training cost we save. We also observe that the number of tokens N is the key to reducing training cost. The number of stage K. To verify the effectiveness of different stage number K in our proposed framework, we choose K = 2, 3, 4 and evaluate the schedules under the similar budgets in the paper. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7, from which we find that K = 3 outperforms K = 2, 4 in all the budgets, thus K = 3 is adopted in our method. 6 CONCLUSION: This paper presents a novel framework for training Vision Transformers at any given budget by reducing the inherent redundancies of the model at the early training stages. We investigate three redundancy factors in Vision Transformers, including attention heads, hidden dimensions in MLP, and visual tokens. Based on these observations, we propose a training strategy to dynamically adjust the activation rate of the model along the training process. Extensive experiments show the effusiveness of our framework with competitive performances on a wide range of training budgets. B RESULTS ON DEIT-B: For DeiT-B, we evaluate our method under the same budgets of 25%, 50% and 75%. As shown in Table 7, there are almost no performance drops of our method as the budgets go smaller whereas the baselines degrade in a large magnitude. Because DeiT-B is a much wider model than DeiT-S, it has more redundancies that can be exploited during training. Nonetheless, larger models require more optimization iterations to converge than the smaller ones, which explains the poor results of the baselines. C MORE ABLATION STUDY: Using less tokens. We provide another baseline of using less tokens by selecting about 25%, 50% and 75% patch tokens in DeiT-S, as shown in Table 9. We observe that only reducing the tokens to save space consumption leads to a sharp performance drop. The implementation of the weights copy. We also investigate the different ways to growing the weight matrices of the projections in the MHSA layer and the MLP layer, as shown in Table 8. We try a total random initialization for the newly activated dimensions, but resulting in a poor performance as listed in the first row. The second row shows that only copying parameters brings about a good performance. Nevertheless, copying the states stored in the optimizer along with the parameters is damaging as the symmetry of the optimization leads to the duplicate weights. The compensation of the replications proposed in (Chen et al., 2015) by multiplying 0.5 in the outgoing weights helps to lift the accuracy to 78.5. However only using this \u00d70.5 technique or adding noise to the grown weights do not help a lot.', 'agent_name': 'RigorousReviewer'}, name='AskAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with ```\n{'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

The paper title is: Budgeted Training for Vision Transformer. INTRODUCTION: Benefited from the large model capacity, Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have demonstrated their predominant performance on various vision tasks, including object detection (Wang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022b), semantic segmentation (Zheng et al., 2021; Strudel et al., 2021), video understanding (Fan et al., 2021; Arnab et al., 2021), etc. However, these improvements come at huge training costs in which the datasets, the model parameters, and the computation complexities have grown enormous in size. For example, ViT-G/14 with Greedy Soup (Wortsman et al., 2022) achieves 90.9% accuracy on the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) benchmark while having 1843M training parameters and being pretrained on a dataset of 3 billion scale. Under this circumstance, computation resource has been becoming an inevitable overhead that prevents common users from training desired vision models. The methodology of designing modern Transformers is finding the best trade-off between the computation costs and the model performances. Besides the widely used factors like the number of the learnable parameters, the floating point operations (FLOPs) and the inference latency, training cost is also an essential resource that involves training schedule (Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2022), memory usage (Pan et al., 2021) and training-stage complexity (Zhang & He, 2020; Gong et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2020). Therefore, the topic of training Transformers efficiently has received broad research interests, especially considering the large-scale data and prolonged schedules in training. Considering that many of the research labs and companies are not able to afford the full training schedule of the best model, one usual solution is to train a better one given a desirable and acceptable total training cost. Previous works that focus on addressing the training efficiency problem mainly learn model-specific schedules based on handcraft designs (Gong et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020; McDanel & Huynh, 2022) or Automated Machine Learning (Li et al., 2022a). However, these approaches either adjust the costs in the training process, or only provide training schedules based on a sparse set of training costs. The inflexibility hinders from generalizing to a pre-defined budget. In this paper, we take a step forward and focus on the problem of budgeted training (Li et al., 2020), i.e., achieving the highest model performance under any given training budget that can be measured by total training time or computation cost. Specifically, we target this problem from the perspective of the inherent properties of Vision Transformers. We show that there exist several types of redundancies during training ViTs, including the feature diversities across different attention heads, the hidden dimensions in the MLP blocks and the number of attended visual tokens. It is shown that these redundancies are correlated with training process, especially they tend to be higher at early stages. This motivates us to dynamically control the activation rate of the model along the training process, where less parameters participate in the early training stages and the full model capacity is activated at late stages. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), we activate 2 attention heads, 51% tokens and 384 MLP hidden dimensions in the first stage, which condenses the model redundancy and keeps a low computation cost, and then the activation rate of the model then gradually increases as training goes on. In this way, the training process becomes more compact, where information loss is greatly avoided and results in limited influence on the model performance. Based on this technique, we can adjust the duration at different level of training stages in order to accommodate to different training budgets. Fig. 1(a) shows our method consistently outperforms the baseline at three different budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the other budgeted training baselines and achieves competitive training cost-performance trade-off on various Vision Transformer models. 2 RELATED WORKS: Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) firstly introduces the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) model into the vision tasks. Wang et al. (2021a; 2022); Liu et al. (2021; 2022) and Zhang et al. (2021a) incorporate the pyramid model architecture with various efficient attention mechanisms for vision. Following the isotropic design, Yuan et al. (2021) leverages overlapped attention, Touvron et al. (2021) benefits from the knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) and Jiang et al. (2021) proposes the token-labeling technique to improve the data efficiency of the Vision Transformer. Redundancies in Transformers have been widely studied in the area of NLP. Michel et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2021b); Voita et al. (2019) prune the redundant attention heads to improve the model efficiency. Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) takes a step further to reuse attention maps in subsequent layers to reduce computations. In vision tasks, the redundancy among visual tokens are of high interest. Wang et al. (2021b) finds that easy samples can be encoded with less tokens. Rao et al. (2021); Xu et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Liang et al. (2022); Song et al. (2021) explore the redundancies in visual tokens by either pruning tokens or introducing sparse computation. Budgeted Training (Li et al., 2020) focuses on training deep neural networks under certain computational resources constraints by linear decaying learning rates. Chen et al. (2022a) proposes an improved schedule named REX in a profile-sampling fashion. Importance sampling methods (Arazo et al., 2021; Andreis et al., 2020) choose the most valuable subset of training data to reduce the training costs with curriculum learning. Pardo et al. (2021) aims to sample informative subset of training data in weakly-supervised object detection. As for the AutoML, Gao et al. (2021) design an automated system to schedule the training tasks according to the budgets. Li et al. (2022a) searches for the optimal training schedule for each budget. Chen et al. (2022b); McDanel & Huynh (2022) can adjust the number of visual tokens during training to adapt to different budgets. 3 REDUNDANCIES DURING TRAINING VITS:  3.1 BACKGROUND OF VISION TRANSFORMER: We first revisit the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). As the variant of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), ViT divides the input H\u00d7W image into a sequence of p\u00d7 p patches in the length of N = HW/p2, and embeds them with linear projections into the Cdimensional subspace. After prepended with a class token and added by a set of position embeddings, the patch embeddings go through subsequent ViT blocks to extract features. The basic building block of ViT consists of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer. The visual tokens are sequentially processed by every block, with LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) and residual connections. Let zl \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the output tokens from the l-th block, the block of ViT is formulated as z\u2032l = zl + MHSA(LN(zl)), zl+1 = z \u2032 l + MLP(LN(z \u2032 l)). (1) The MHSA is introduced to learn different representations from separate attention heads. Let q,k,v \u2208 RN\u00d7C be the query, key and value tokens projected by learnable weights Wq,Wk,Wv \u2208 RC\u00d7C , the attention of the m-th head among M heads is computed as h(m) = softmax ( q(m)k(m)\u22a4/ \u221a d ) v(m), (2) where d = C/m is the dimension of each head. And then the attention heads are concatenated together to produce the final output, followed by a linear projection WO \u2208 RC\u00d7C , written as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M))WO. (3) The MLP is implemented as two fully-connected layers denoted as \u03d51(\u00b7) and \u03d52(\u00b7), with a GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) non-linearity inserted between them. The \u03d51(\u00b7) takes in the tokens with C1 dimension and projects them to a subspace with dimension C2 \u2265 C1. After the activation, these tokens are projected back to C1 dimension as the output of the MLP. We denote the proportion \u03b3 = C2/C1 as the MLP ratio in the remaining paper. In this section we opt a representative ViT architecture, DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), to analyze the redundancies in ViT training. The same conclusions can be generalized to other Transformer architectures. 3.2 REDUNDANCIES IN ATTENTION HEADS: There are six heads in each MHSA layer of DeiT-S, where each head holds a 64-dim representation to compute self-attention. A question will be raised: are all the heads important? In the natural language processing (NLP), it has been observed that zeroing out the representations of some heads or even keeping only one head active is enough to preserve the model performance at the test time (Michel et al., 2019). Bhojanapalli et al. (2021) finds that the attention maps of heads share high similarities between consecutive layers in both vision and NLP tasks. However, few studies inspect this question from the perspective of training. We compare the CKA similarity between every pair of heads to assess their redundancies. CKA is short for centered kernel alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019; Raghu et al., 2021; Cortes et al., 2012), which is a popular metric to quantize the similarity between the representation of each head. CKA takes two activation matrices X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p1 ,Y \u2208 Rm\u00d7p2 in the networks as input, and computes the Gram matrices L = XX\u22a4,K = YY\u22a4. By centering the Gram matrices by H = I \u2212 1m11 \u22a4, K\u0304 = HKH, L\u0304 = HLH, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2007) and the CKA are computed as CKA(K,L) = HSIC(K,L)\u221a HSIC(K,K)HSIC(L,L) , HSIC(K,L) = vec(K\u0304) \u00b7 vec(L\u0304) (m\u2212 1)2 . (4) We compute the CKA(h(i)l ,h (j) l ) for each pair of the i-th and the j-th head in the l-th block of the DeiT-S model on ImageNet validation set, where h(i)l is the output feature of every separate head attention in Eq.(2) before the concatenation and projection in Eq.(3). As shown in Fig. 2(a), there are significant descents of these similarities in some multi-head attention blocks. For example, the CKA score in block04 first grows over 0.6 and rapidly decreases to nearly zero as training goes on. To show this trend more clearly, Fig. 2(b) displays the dynamics of similarity matrices at different epochs. From these observations, there exist considerable redundancies between the attention heads and the redundancies are decreasing during the training, which enlightens us to activate fewer heads during the early stage of the training. 3.3 REDUNDANCIES IN MLP HIDDEN DIMENSIONS: The dimension expansion and contraction design in the MLP layer of ViTs extracts features by projecting and activating them in a higher-dimensional space, which brings in a great deal of redundancies in features. The searched optimal architectures in ViT-Slim (Chavan et al., 2022) also reveal this type of redundancy in which lots of the hidden dimensions in MLP layers are removed. In terms of training, we leverage the principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze these redundancies among the features in the expanded dimension space projected by \u03d51(\u00b7) in the MLP block. For each token \u03d51(x) \u2208 RN\u00d7C2 in the MLP block of DeiTS, we compute its number of principal components that hold a given proportion of the explained variance. This criterion has been also adopted in pruning redundant neurons in deep networks (Casper et al., 2021). We choose the 99% threshold to measure the alternation of the principal components distribution during training. We plot the numbers of principal components w.r.t. the training epochs in Fig. 3. It is observed that the numbers of principal components are growing as the training epoch increases in the shallow and middle blocks. This phenomenon indicates that in the early training stages, only a few components can hold the most explained variances, i.e., support the projected space. Therefore the redundancies in the early stages of training are in high degree, especially in the shallow blocks. For the deep blocks there also exist the trends of increase of the numbers of components, however they are relatively noisy so we omit them in the figure. This observation demonstrates that the features are highly linearly dependent in early epochs, lacking diversities among dimensions. As the training goes on, the redundan- cies are gradually declining, achieving a final state with much fewer redundancies. It suggests that a large MLP ratio \u03b3 with high hidden dimensions at the early training stage be excessive and a growing \u03b3 from a smaller value would be beneficial to alleviating this redundancy. 3.4 REDUNDANCIES IN VISUAL TOKENS: The spatial redundancies in the visual tokens have been widely studied. Many efficient Vision Transformers have sought to eliminate the redundancies during inference time (Wang et al., 2021b; Rao et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022). We follow this line of research to investigate the redundancies among tokens during the training procedure, leveraging the visualization of the class attention. The class attention score is defined as the attention between the class token qcls and other patch tokens k, i.e., Acls = softmax(qclsk\u22a4/ \u221a d). If we view these attention scores as a distribution, the patch tokens with high scores contribute more to the class token, which indicates the informative tokens of the important image patches. As illustrated in Fig. 4, we observe that the patch tokens with higher attention scores first emerge in a small area of the image. And then more patches on the target object begin to get a higher class attention score during training, indicating there are some redundancies in the patch tokens at the early stage of training. This phenomenon exists in some shallow blocks while the class attention in the deep blocks displays a nearly uniform distribution among all visual tokens. Since the effective receptive field of ViTs grow very quickly as the block goes deeper (d\u2019Ascoli, 2021; Raghu et al., 2021), the class attention degenerates to a global-pooling operation to aggregate all the tokens. This trend appeals to us to reduce the number of visual tokens in early epochs. 4 BUDGETED TRAINING FOR VISION TRANSFORMER: Different from most of the previous works that improves training efficiency based on a fixed schedule, our target is to propose a flexible training framework that can easily adapt to a wide range of training budgets while maintaining competitive performances. In the following, we would first define the problem of budgeted training and then show how we solve the problem by leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers. 4.1 BUDGETED TRAINING: The total cost of training a deep neural network M can be defined as the accumulation of the model\u2019s computation cost over all the training steps. The budgeted training problem is to minimize the objective loss such that the total computation costs C(M) of training are under the given budget constraint B, min \u0398 L(M;D), s.t. C(M) = \u222b Tmax 0 C(T ;M) dT \u2264 B, (5) where C(T ;M) is the computation cost of the model M at the T -th training epoch. Nevertheless, considering the computational intractability of the integration and the potential additional inefficiency when frequently switching the training cost C(T ;M) at different epochs, we simplify the optimization problem by dividing the total training process into several stages and hypothesize the training cost remains unchanged in each stage. Specifically, we divide a training procedure with Tmax epochs into K stages satisfying \u2211K k=1 Tk = Tmax, and we denote Ck as the training cost of model M at the k-th stage. In this way, the optimization can be formulated as: min \u0398 L(f(X;\u0398),Y), s.t. K\u2211 k=1 CkTk \u2264 B, (6) where f(\u00b7;\u0398) is the deep neural network M parameterized by its weights \u0398, {(X,Y) \u2208 D} is the input-label pair of training samples and L(\u00b7, \u00b7) defines the loss function of the objective. Also, it is noticeable that when we set B = CK and Tmax = TK = B/CK , it decreases to the common training schedule where full model is trained for all training epochs. 4.2 LEVERAGING REDUNDANCIES IN VISION TRANSFORMER: Most previous works (Li et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022a) that focus on budgeted training propose to adjust the length of training epochs to meet the specific demand on the total training cost. Despite its simplicity, these approaches usually suffer from inherent limitations that fail to make use of the model\u2019s characteristics. Nevertheless, the analysis in Sec. 3 motivates us to tackle this task from an alternative perspective, where we focus on leveraging the redundancies of Vision Transformers along the training process. Specifically, we focus on the number of attention heads, MLP hidden dimension, and the number of visual tokens that have shown great redundancies in Vision Transformers, and propose to reduce their complexity with respect to the training stages. Given a Vision Transformer with M attention heads. Denote C as the MLP hidden dimension and N as the number of visual tokens for each input image. At the first stage of training, only part of the attention heads are activated and the multi-head self-attention in Eq.(3) can be reformulated as z = CONCAT(h(1),h(2), . . . ,h(M (1)))W (1) O , (7) where M (1) denotes the number of activated head, and W(1)O \u2208 R m M C\u00d7C contains the m/M part of the input dimension of the original projection matrix WO. The projection matrices Wq,Wk,Wv for queries, keys and values are adjusted in the same way by activating m/M of their output dimensions, i.e., W(1)q ,W (1) k ,W (1) v \u2208 RC\u00d7 m M C . Similarly, for MLP hidden dimension, only C(1)2 of C2 channels are activated in the MLP layers by incorporating a smaller MLP ratio \u03b3. We illustrate the growing process of the MLP ratio in Fig. 5, and the growing of attention heads follow the same recipe. As for the number of visual tokens, we manually drop some of the tokens, and only reserve N (1) to extract the image features. In practice, we set higher prior on the center region of the image, and mainly drop the tokens at the edges of image to avoid severe information loss. As the training progresses, the redundancies in the aforementioned aspects are gradually decreased. Also, model performances will be highly restricted as the model complexity is limited. Therefore, for later stages in the training schedule, we propose to gradually turn on the inactive part of the model, and eventually recover the model capacity by activating the whole model. However, comparing to the activated components that have been trained for a certain of epochs, the inactive part remains the same status as initialization, which is usually randomly sampled from a certain distribution. In this way, simply adding these parts to the training process may result in an imbalance of optimization, and results in degraded model performances. This problem is inevitable when activating the learnable weights for additional attention heads and MLP ratio. Therefore, to avoid the training instability, we propose to make use of the activated parts, and use their weights as the initialization. To avoid having same gradient with copied parameters, we choose to drop the statistical information of the parameters reserved in the optimizer, including their first and second order momenta in the AdamW. Consequently, this results in a diverse gradient direction, and successfully maintain the training stability. 4.3 ADAPTING VISION TRANSFORMER TO BUDGETS: By leveraging the technique we described in Sec. 4.2, the training cost of the models at different stages Ck are controlled according to the fraction of activated components. In this way, given any training budget B, we carefully adjust the duration of each stages Tk and finally satisfies the training constraint \u2211K k=1 CkTk \u2264 B in Eq.(6). Specifically, we employ a family of exponential functions as the prior distribution to sample the duration of each training stage. K random seeds are first sampled from a uniform distribution in the range (0, 1), and then mapped by an exponential function parameterized by a scalar \u03b1: tk = exp (\u03b1sk). The scalar \u03b1 practically reflects the sampling bias towards different stages, i.e., a larger \u03b1 induces larger tks for the later training stages and smaller tks for the early ones. Finally, to fit the total training cost into given training budget, we linearly scale the duration of each stages: Tk = \u230aB/ K\u2211 k=1 bk\u230btk. (8) 5 EXPERIMENTS:  5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: Datasets and models. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet-1K (Deng et al., 2009) dataset for large scale image recognition, which contains 1.28M training examples and 50K validation examples of 1000 classes. We choose three famous families of Vision Transformers, DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), Pyramid Vision Transformer v2 (PVTv2) (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021). DeiT is a classical yet powerful baseline of the isotropic ViTs while PVTv2 and Swin Transformer serve as strong baselines of the ViTs with multiscale feature structures. Implementation details. We follow most of the hyper-parameters of these models including architecture configurations, data augmentations, and stochastic depth rate (Huang et al., 2016). As discussed in Sec. 4.2, we adjust three factors controlling the training cost of the model, including the number of the activated attention heads M , the MLP hidden dimension C, and the proportion of patch tokens N . The detailed specifications are summarized in the appendix. In our method, we choose a moderate \u03b1 = 2.0 in K = 3 training stages. Baselines. In the field of budgeted training, there are two approaches by scheduling learning rate, among which Linear-LR (Li et al., 2020) propose a linear learning rate decay schedule and REXLR (Chen et al., 2022a) design a schedule reflecting the exponential decay. We select these two popular and recent methods as our baselines, which adapt to the given training budget by compressing total epochs in training. For example, let Tmax be the maximum epoch in training at full budget, the two baselines set the epochs to T = 0.5Tmax to meet the 50% budget. Specifically, Linear-LR and REX-LR formulate the learning rate schedules \u03b7linear and \u03b7REX as \u03b7linear(t) = \u03b70(1\u2212 t/T ), \u03b7REX(t) = \u03b70 ( 1\u2212 t/T 0.5 + 0.5(1\u2212 t/T ) ) , (9) where \u03b70 is the initial learning rate, t, T are the current epoch and the total epochs in training. 5.2 BUDGETED TRAINING OF VITS: We report the results of our method and the budgeted training baselines on DeiT-S (Touvron et al., 2021), PVTv2-b2linear (Wang et al., 2022), and Swin-S (Liu et al., 2021). The training cost is the sum of the FLOPs of the model along all the epochs in training. We choose 25%, 50% and 75% for budgeted training. For the learning rate scheduler baselines, we directly discount the number of epochs from 300 to 75, 150, and 225 respectively. For our method, we sample each Tk under the given budget to fit the constraint by Eq.(8). 100% training budget:  75% training budget:  50% training budget:  25% training budget: We summarize our results in Tab. 1, in which our method outperforms two baselines consistently on the three models in terms of Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K validation dataset. For DeiT-S, our method achieves +1.3%, +0.8%, and +0.5% over the baselines on the three training budgets. For The results on PVTv2 and Swin-S models also shows the superiority of our method to the learning rate scheduling techniques. When using full training budget, our method has significant improvements in 1.0% over the original models. Fig. 6 also illustrates the effectiveness of our method. 5.3 ANALYSES: Restricting training epochs. We add another extra constraint that the number of total epochs is limited to 300 as the original model to check the flexibility of our framework. Tab. 2 shows that if the total epochs remain unchanged as the training budget goes low, the training cost is likely to exceed the budget and the performances of models are faded. Therefore, the total epochs should be adjusted according to the budgets in the scheme of multiple stages of different model complexities. Training time. We report the training time of our methods on DeiT-S in Tab. 3. Under 75% FLOPs training budget, our framework saves the training time over 11% in terms of GPU hours without performance drop. Under other budgets, our method also achieves considerable time saving with competitive model performances. Because the total training time is heavily influenced by the CPUs and I/O of the file system, we measure the time of forward and backward passes only to further assess the time saving. It is observed that the saved foward and backward time is more close to the saved training budgets, which implies our method could save more training time in total provided optimized hardware systems. 5.4 ABLATION STUDY: Scalar \u03b1 in Tk sampling controls the growth rate of the exponential function. As shown in Tab. 4, \u03b1 = 5.0 compress the first two stages in less than 20 epochs. When \u03b1 is large enough, the epochs of last training stage TK will dominate all the training epochs, which comes to the case CK = B as Li et al. (2020). If \u03b1 is set to 0, all tks are equal. And when \u03b1 is negative, early tks will become large rather than the later tks, which results in degradation in model performance by -0.7% and -0.9%. Different activated components. As summarized in Tab. 5, we evaluate different types of combination of the activated components on DeiT-S with a fixed schedule [50,100,150]. M , N , C mean adopting the attention heads, tokens and MLP hidden dimensions as the activated components, respectively. The more components partially activated we used in budgeted training, the more training cost we save. We also observe that the number of tokens N is the key to reducing training cost. The number of stage K. To verify the effectiveness of different stage number K in our proposed framework, we choose K = 2, 3, 4 and evaluate the schedules under the similar budgets in the paper. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7, from which we find that K = 3 outperforms K = 2, 4 in all the budgets, thus K = 3 is adopted in our method. 6 CONCLUSION: This paper presents a novel framework for training Vision Transformers at any given budget by reducing the inherent redundancies of the model at the early training stages. We investigate three redundancy factors in Vision Transformers, including attention heads, hidden dimensions in MLP, and visual tokens. Based on these observations, we propose a training strategy to dynamically adjust the activation rate of the model along the training process. Extensive experiments show the effusiveness of our framework with competitive performances on a wide range of training budgets. B RESULTS ON DEIT-B: For DeiT-B, we evaluate our method under the same budgets of 25%, 50% and 75%. As shown in Table 7, there are almost no performance drops of our method as the budgets go smaller whereas the baselines degrade in a large magnitude. Because DeiT-B is a much wider model than DeiT-S, it has more redundancies that can be exploited during training. Nonetheless, larger models require more optimization iterations to converge than the smaller ones, which explains the poor results of the baselines. C MORE ABLATION STUDY: Using less tokens. We provide another baseline of using less tokens by selecting about 25%, 50% and 75% patch tokens in DeiT-S, as shown in Table 9. We observe that only reducing the tokens to save space consumption leads to a sharp performance drop. The implementation of the weights copy. We also investigate the different ways to growing the weight matrices of the projections in the MHSA layer and the MLP layer, as shown in Table 8. We try a total random initialization for the newly activated dimensions, but resulting in a poor performance as listed in the first row. The second row shows that only copying parameters brings about a good performance. Nevertheless, copying the states stored in the optimizer along with the parameters is damaging as the symmetry of the optimization leads to the duplicate weights. The compensation of the replications proposed in (Chen et al., 2015) by multiplying 0.5 in the outgoing weights helps to lift the accuracy to 78.5. However only using this \u00d70.5 technique or adding noise to the grown weights do not help a lot.', 'agent_name': 'RigorousReviewer'}`\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
