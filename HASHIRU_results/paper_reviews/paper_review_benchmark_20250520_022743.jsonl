The paper title is: Multi-User Reinforcement Learning with Low Rank Rewards\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Reinforcement learning has recently seen tremendous empirical and theoretical success Mnih et al. (2015); Sutton et al. (1992); Jin et al. (2020b); Zanette et al. (2020); Gheshlaghi Azar et al. (2013); Dann & Brunskill (2015). Theoretically, near optimal algorithms have been proposed to explore and learn a given MDP with sample access to trajectories. In this work, we consider the problem of learning the optimal policies for multiple MDPs collaboratively so that the total number of trajectories sampled per MDP is smaller the number of trajectories required to learn them individually. This combines reinforcement learning and the supervised learning perspective on collaborative filtering. We assume that the various users have the same transition matrices, but different rewards and the rewards have a low rank structure in order to facilitate collaborative filtering. Low rank assumption is popular in the collaborative filtering literature and has been deployed successfully in a variety of tasks Bell & Koren (2007); Gleich & Lim (2011); Hsieh et al. (2012). This can be regarded as an instance of multi-task reinforcement, various versions of which have been considered in the literature Brunskill & Li (2013); Taylor & Stone (2009); D\u2019Eramo et al. (2020); Teh et al. (2017); Hessel et al. (2019). A Motivating Example Consider the example of travel itinerary/ navigation suggestion generation for multiple users, where each user has a different preference for travel. In the case of navigation, some users might prefer taking buses, some might prefer taking the metro and others might prefer to take the taxi at different spots. In the case of travel, some might like traveling to museums and big cities while some others might prefer camping. We can model the state as being the current place being visited during the trip and the action as the means of transportation which changes the current state. In this scenario, each person can be assumed to have the same state-space, action space and the same state transition matrix. However, these users obtain different \u2018rewards\u2019 since they have different preferences for places and modes of transportation. We want to understand how to plan each of their travel without having each of the users visit every destination using every mode of transportation as required by the usual reinforcement learning methods. Our Contributions a) Improved Sample Complexity: In this work, we introduce the setting of multi-user collaborative reinforcement learning in the case of tabular MDPs and linear MDPs and provide sample efficient algorithms for both these scenarios without access to a generative model. The total sample complexity required to learn the near-optimal policies for every user scales as O(N + |S||A|) instead of O(N |S||A|) in the case of tabular MDPs and O(N + d) instead of O(Nd2) in the case of linear MDPs. b) Collaborative Exploration: In order to reconstruct the rewards of all the users efficiently under low-rank assumptions, we need to deploy standard low rank matrix estimation/completion algorithms. These algorithms require specific kinds of linear measurements (See Section 1.1) with certain distributional properties. Without access to a generative model, the main challenge in this setting is to obtain these linear measurements by querying trajectories of carefully designed policies. In the case of Tabular MDPs, a natural and elegant algorithm (Algorithm 1) allows us to obtain uniformly distributed observations which allow efficient matrix completion. c) Functional Reward Maximization: In the case of linear MDPs, matrix completion is more challenging since we observe measurements of the form e\u22bai \u0398 \u2217\u03c8 where \u0398\u2217 \u2208 RN\u00d7d, corresponding to the reward obtained by user i, with respect to an embedding \u03c8. Estimating \u0398\u2217 under low rank assumptions requires the distribution of \u03c8 to have certain isotropy properties (see Section 6). Querying such measurements goes beyond the usual reward maximization and are related to mean-field limits of multi-agent reinforcement learning similar to the setting in Cammardella et al. (2020) where a functional of the distribution of the states is optimized. Using some structural results for Linear MDPs, we design a procedure which can sample-efficiently estimate policies which lead to these isotropic measurements (Section 5). d) Matrix Completion With Row-Wise Linear Measurements: For the linear MDP setting, the low rank matrix estimation problem lies somewhere in between the matrix completion (Recht, 2011; Jain et al., 2013) and matrix estimation with restricted strong convexity (Negahban et al., 2009). We give a novel active learning based algorithm where we estimate \u0398\u2217 row by row without any assumptions like incoherence. This is described in Section 6. 1.1 RELATED WORKS: Related Settings: Multi-task Reinforcement learning has been studied empirically and theoretically Brunskill & Li (2013); Taylor & Stone (2009); D\u2019Eramo et al. (2020); Teh et al. (2017); Hessel et al. (2019); Sodhani et al. (2021). Modi et al. (2017) considers learning a sequence of MDPs with side information (or context), where the parameters of the MDP varies smoothly with the context. Shah et al. (2020) introduced the setting where the optimal Q function Q\u2217(s, a), when represented as a S \u00d7 A matrix has low rank. With a generative model, they obtain algorithms which makes use of this structure to obtain a smaller sample complexity whenever the discount factor is bounded by a constant. Sam et al. (2022) improves the results in this setting by considering additional assumptions like low rank transition kernels. Our setting is different in that we consider multiple users, but do not consider access to a generative model. In fact our main contribution is to efficiently obtain measurements conducive to matrix completion without a generative model. Hu et al. (2021) considers a multi-task RL problem with linear function approximation similar to our setting, but with the assumption of low-rank Bellman closure, where the application of the Bellman operator retains the low rank structure. They obtain a bound depending on the quantity N \u221a d instead of (N + d) like in our work. Lei & Li (2019) considers multi-task RL with low rank setting, which is very similar to our setting, in an experimental context. Low Rank Matrix Estimation: Low rank matrix estimation has been extensively studied in the statistics and ML community for decades in the context of supervised learning Cande\u0300s & Tao (2010); Negahban & Wainwright (2011); Fazel (2002); Chen et al. (2019); Jain et al. (2013; 2017); Recht (2011) in multi-user collaborative filtering settings. The basic question is to estimate a d1 \u00d7 d2 matrix M given linear measurements (x\u22baiMyi) n i=1 when the number of samples is much smaller than d1 \u00d7 d2 using the assumption that M has low rank. a) Matrix Completion: xi and yi are standard basis vectors. Hence we observe some entries of the matrix M . Typically xi and yi are picked uniformly at random and recovery guarantees are given whenever the matrix M is incoherent (Recht, 2011). b) Matrix Estimation: xi and yi are not restricted to be standard basis vectors. Typically, they are chosen i.i.d such that the restricted strong convexity holds (Negahban et al., 2009). In this work, we consider MDPs associated with N users such that their reward matrix satisfies a low rank structure. For the case of tabular MDPs, we use the matrix completion setting and for the case of linear MDPs, our setting lies some where in between settings a) and b) as explained above. 1.2 NOTATION: By \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 we denote the Euclidean norm and by e1, . . . , ei, . . . the standard basis vectors of the space Rm for some m \u2208 N. Let Sd\u22121 := {x \u2208 Rd : \u2225x\u2225 = 1}. Let Bd(r) := {x \u2208 Rd : \u2225x\u2225 \u2264 r}. For any m \u00d7 n matrix A and a set \u2126 \u2286 [n] by A\u2126, we denote the sub-matrix of A where the columns corresponding to \u2126\u2201 are deleted. 2 PROBLEM SETTING: We consider N users indexed by [N ], each of them associated with a horizon H MDP with the same state-space S, the same action space A and same transition matrices P = (P1, . . . , PH\u22121), where Ph(\u00b7|sh, ah) is a probability measure over S, which gives the distribution of the state at time h + 1 given the action ah was taken in state sh at time h. Each user has a different reward denoted by Ru = (R1u, . . . , RHu) where Rhu : S \u00d7 A \u2192 [0, 1]. Denote the MDP associated with the user u byMu := (S,A,P,Ru). For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the rewards are deterministic. We assume that all the MDPs start at a random state S1 having the same distribution. Consider a policy \u03a0 := (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H) where \u03c0h : \u2206(A) \u00d7 S \u2192 R+ is a kernel - i.e, \u03c0h(da|s) gives the probability distribution over actions given a state s at time h. By (S1:H , A1:H) we denote the trajectory (S1, A1), (S2, A2), . . . , (SH , AH) \u2208 S \u00d7 A. By (S1:H , A1:H) \u223c M(\u03a0) we mean the random trajectory under the policy \u03a0 - where Ah = \u03c0h(Sh) and Sh+1 \u223c Ph(\u00b7|Sh, Ah). That is, it is the trajectory of the MDP under the policy \u03a0. Define the value function ofMu under policy \u03a0 as: V (\u03a0,Mu) := E(S1:H ,A1:H)\u223c\u03a0 \u2211H h=1Rhu(Sh, Ah). We will call a policy \u03a0\u0302u to be \u03f5 optimal for Mu if V (\u03a0\u0302u,Mu) \u2265 sup\u03a0 V (\u03a0,Mu)\u2212 \u03f5. The goal of this paper is to design algorithms to find \u03f5 optimal policies for every u \u2208 [N ] with as few samples as possible under low rank assumptions on the rewards Ruh. Reward Free Exploration: The objective of reward free RL is to explore an MDP without collecting rewards. After collecting K trajectories from the MDP sequentially (denoted by DK), the algorithm outputs functions \u03a0\u0302 and V\u0302 whose input is a reward functionR = (Rh(\u00b7, \u00b7))Hh=1 (bounded between [0, 1]) and the output is a nearly-optimal policy \u03a0\u0302(R) and its estimated value V\u0302 (\u03a0\u0302(R)) for this reward function. Denote the MDP with this reward function by MR. Given \u03f5 > 0 and \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1], we let Krf(\u03f5, \u03b4) to be such that whenever K \u2265 Krf(\u03f5, \u03b4), with probability at-least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 we have: a) supR |V (\u03a0\u0302,MR)\u2212 V\u0302 (\u03a0\u0302(R))| \u2264 \u03f5 and b) \u03a0\u0302 is an \u03f5 optimal policy forMR for everyR. This setting was introduced in Jin et al. (2020a). In this work, we will use the reward free exploration algorithms in Zhang et al. (2020) for tabular MDPs and Wagenmaker et al. (2022) for linear MDPs. Note that since all the users in our setting have the same transition probabilities, we can run reward free RL in a distributed fashion over the users. Tabular MDP Setting S and A are finite sets. Denote the reward Rhu(s, a) by the N \u00d7 |S||A| matrix Rh where Rh(u, (s, a)) = Rhu(s, a). We have the following low-rank assumption: Assumption (Tab) 1. The matrix Rh has rank r for some r \u2264 12 min(N, |S||A|). Linear MDP Setting Our definition is slightly different from the one in Jin et al. (2020b). In this setting, we consider embeddings \u03d5 : S \u00d7 A \u2192 Rd, \u03c8 : S \u00d7 A \u2192 Rd such that \u2225\u03d5(s, a)\u22251 \u2264 1, \u2225\u03c8(s, a)\u22252 \u2264 1. We make the following assumptions: 1. There exists \u03b8hu \u2208 Rd, \u2225\u03b8hu\u22252 \u2264 \u221a d such thatRhu(s, a) = \u27e8\u03b8hu, \u03c8(s, a)\u27e9 andRh(s, a) \u2208 [0, 1]. 2. There exist signed measures \u00b51h, . . . , \u00b5dh over the space S such that: Ph(\u00b7|s, a) =\u2211d i=1 \u00b5ih(\u00b7)\u27e8\u03d5(s, a), ei\u27e9 For simplicity, we will assume that \u00b5i are such that \u2225 \u222b \u00b5ih(ds)\u03d5(s, a)\u03c0(da|s)\u22251 \u2264 1. This is true whenever \u00b5ih are probability measures. We will assume that supi,h \u222b |\u00b5ih(ds)| \u2264 C\u00b5. We consider different embeddings for transition (\u03d5) and reward (\u03c8) as the transition embeddings have a natural \u2225 \u00b7\u22251 structure since they give linear combinations of measure which make up Ph(\u00b7|s, a). We denote the N \u00d7 d matrix whose u-th row is \u03b8\u22bauh to be \u0398h. The low-rank assumption in this setting takes the following form: Assumption (Lin) 1. . The N \u00d7 d matrix \u0398h has rank r \u2264 12 min(N, d). For the task of reward maximization in Linear MDPs, deterministic policies of the form \u03c0h(s) = arg supa\u27e8\u03c8(s, a), u\u2217h\u27e9+\u27e8\u03d5(s, a), v\u2217h\u27e9 suffice, for u\u2217h, v\u2217h \u2208 Rd. Since we want to complete the matrix \u0398h, we get data of the form (ei, \u03c8(Sh, Ah), e \u22ba i \u0398h\u03c8(Sh, Ah)). In order to achieve matrix estimation in this setting, we need to query (Sh, Ah) such that the distribution of \u03c8(Sh, Ah) is \u2018nearly isotropic\u2019 (See Section 6). Such (Sh, Ah) cannot necessarily be obtained as a result of reward maximization policy of a single agent and is related to mean-field limit of multi-agent RL (similar to the setting in Cammardella et al. (2020)), and it could necessarily be a randomized policy. This presents additional problems that the space of possible policies can be very large and intractable. Therefore, we restrict our attention to policies given by some fixed policy space Q. With some abuse of notation, we define the total variation distance between two kernels as: TV(\u03c0h, \u03c0\u2032h) := sups\u2208S TV(\u03c0h(\u00b7|s), \u03c0\u2032h(\u00b7|s)). We define a distance over Q by DQ(\u03a0(1),\u03a0(2)) = suph\u2208[H] TV(\u03c0 (1) h , \u03c0 (2) h ), where \u03a0 (i) = (\u03c0 (i) h : h \u2208 [H]). We refer to Section A for additional discussion on the above observations, connections to multi-agent mean-field RL and construction of Q such that it contains all \u03f5-optimal policies for every possible linear reward. 3 THE ALGORITHM: Our algorithm proceeds in 4 phases. 3.1 TABULAR MDP CASE:: Phase 1: Reward Free Exploration We run the reward free RL algorithm in Zhang et al. (2020) for Krf( \u03f58 , \u03b4 2 ) = C |S||A|H2 ( |S|+log( 1\u03b4 ) ) \u03f52 polylog( |S||A|H \u03f5 ) time steps by picking the MDP corresponding to a uniformly random user whenever the reward free RL algorithm queries a trajectory. Let the output of the reward free RL algorithm be \u03a0\u0302 and V\u0302 . We do not use the rewards collected at this stage. Phase 2: Querying the Reward Matrix In this phase we query a \u2018uniform mask\u2019 with the parameter p for the reward matrix Rh using Algorithm 1. For each (s, a) \u2208 S \u00d7 A and h \u2208 [H], maintain a counter Th,(s,a) for (s, a) \u2208 S \u00d7 A and h \u2208 [H], initialized at 0. Given the \u2018active sets\u2019 G = (Gh)h\u2208[H] \u2286 S \u00d7A and h \u2208 [H], we define the reward J (;G) = (J1, . . . , Jh) by Jh(s, a;G) = 1((s, a) \u2208 Gh) (1) We will denote this reward by J (\u00b7;G). Initialize active set G = (Gh)h\u2208[H] such that Gh = S \u00d7 A. We initialize the reward matrix R\u0302h(u, (s, a)) = \u2217, where \u2217 denotes unknown entry. Phase 3: Reward Matrix Completion We receive Gh and the partially observed matrix R\u0302h for each h as the output of Algorithm 1. By R\u0302G \u2201 h h , we denote the sub-matrix where the columns corresponding to Gh are deleted. We use the nuclear norm minimization algorithm given in Recht (2011) to recover R G\u2201h h from R\u0302 G\u2201h h for every h \u2208 [H]. Phase 4: Computing the Optimal Policy Phase 3 outputs the completed sub-matrix RG \u2201 h h , where only the columns corresponding to |G\u2201h| are recovered. We construct the recovered matrix R\u0304h by setting R\u0304G \u2201 h h = R G\u2201h h and R\u0304 Gh h = 0. We compute the optimal policy for each user using the rewards from R\u0304h via the output of the reward free RL, \u03a0\u0302, from Phase 1. Output: Active sets Gh, Partially compete matrix R\u0302h t\u2190 0 ; P\u0302G \u2190 V\u0302 (J (\u00b7;G)); \u03a0\u0302G \u2190 \u03a0\u0302(J (\u00b7;G)); while P\u0302G > \u03f52 do Ut \u2190 Unif([N ]) ; // Pick a user uniformly at random S (t) 1:H , A (t) 1:H , R (t) 1:H \u223cMUt(\u03a0\u0302G) ; // Query trajectory for h \u2208 [H] do if (S(t)h , A (t) h ) \u2208 Gh and Rh(Ut, (S (t) h , A (t) h )) = \u2217 then T h,(S (t) h ,A (t) h ) \u2190 T h,(S (t) h ,A (t) h ) + 1 ; // Increment count R\u0302h(Ut, (S (t) h , A (t) h ))\u2190 R (t) h ; // Fill Missing Entry end if T h,(S (t) h ,A (t) h ) = Np then Gh \u2190 Gh \\ {(S(t)h , A (t) h )} ; // Remove element from Active Set end end t\u2190 t+ 1 ; P\u0302G \u2190 V\u0302 (J (\u00b7;G)); \u03a0\u0302G \u2190 \u03a0\u0302(J (\u00b7;G)); end Algorithm 1: Uniform Mask Sampler for Tabular MDPs 3.2 LINEAR MDP CASE:: Phase 1 : Reward Free RL We run the reward free RL algorithm for Linear MDPs from Wagenmaker et al. (2022), with error \u03f5 and probability of failure \u03b44 . We use trajectories from random users whenever a trajectory is queried. Here, Krf(\u03f5, \u03b4/4) = CdH5(d+log( 1 \u03b4 )) \u03f52 + Cd9/2H6 log4( 1 \u03b4 ) \u03f5 . Phase 2: Querying Linear Measurements of the Reward Matrix Low rank matrix estimation in the general context requires measurements which have certain distributional properties. We find such a policy in two steps. Step 1: For each time step h \u2208 [H], we want to query obtain samples (s(t)h , a (t) h ) such that\u2211T t=1 \u03d5(s (t) h , a (t) h )\u03d5 \u22ba(s (t) h , a (t) h ) \u2ab0 \u03ba2I . This can be done by Algorithm 2. Given a projector Q to some subspace of Rd, by Qh,Q denote the reward \u2225Q\u03d5(s, a)\u22252 at time h and 0 otherwise. Step 2: Using the observations given in Step 1, we compute the policy \u03a0\u0302f,h which approximately satisfies the property given in Assumption 3. This procedure is described in Section 5. Phase 3: Estimating Low Rank Reward Matrix For this, we use the active learning procedure given in Section 6 via row-wise linear measurements along with the policy \u03a0MC = \u03a0\u0302f,h, which was computed in Phase 2. Phase 4: Computing the Optimal Policy Once the reward matrix \u0398h have been reconstructed for every h in Phase 3, we use the output of reward free RL in order to compute the \u03f5 optimal policy for each user. 4 MAIN RESULTS:  4.1 TABULAR MDP:: The standard assumption for low rank matrix completion is that of incoherence, which ensures that the matrix is not too sparse so that sparse measurements are sufficient to learn it. The following definition is used in Recht (2011). Input: Total time T ; Tolerance \u03b3; lower isometry constant \u03ba Output: \u03d5ht, S(h+1)t for h \u2208 [H \u2212 1], t \u2208 [T ] h\u2190 1 ; while h \u2264 H \u2212 1 do Q\u2190 I ; \u03a0\u0302Q \u2190 \u03a0\u0302(Qh,Q) ; G\u03d5,h \u2190 0 ; // Grammian initialized to 0 t\u2190 1 ; while t \u2264 T do Ut \u223c Unif([N ]) ; // Pick a uniformly random user S1:H , A1:H \u223cMUt(\u03a0\u0302Q) ; // Obtain Trajectory \u03d5ht \u2190 \u03d5(Sh, Ah) ; S(h+1)t \u2190 Sh+1 ; G\u03d5,h \u2190 G\u03d5,h + \u03d5ht\u03d5\u22baht ; // Update Grammian if \u2203y \u2208 Sd\u22121 : y\u22baG\u03d5,hy < \u03ba2 then Q\u2190 the eigenspace of G\u03d5,h with eigenvalues < \u03ba2I; \u03a0\u0302Q \u2190 \u03a0\u0302(Qh,Q) ; end t\u2190 t+ 1 end h\u2190 h+ 1 end Algorithm 2: Well Conditioned Matrix Sampler Definition 1. Given a r dimensional sub-space U of Rn , we define the coherence of as: \u00b5(U) := n r sup 1\u2264i\u2264n \u2225PUei\u22252 . A n1 \u00d7 n2 matrix M with singular value decomposition U\u03a3V \u22ba is called (\u00b50, \u00b51) coherent if: a) The coherence of the row and column spaces of M are at-most \u00b50 b) The absolute value of every: entry of UV \u22ba is bounded above by \u00b51 \u221a r n1n2 . Given a policy \u03a0, and \u2126 \u2286 S \u00d7 A, by P\u03a0h (\u2126) we denote the probability that at time h we have (Sh, Ah) \u2208 \u2126 under the policy \u03a0. Assumption (Tab) 2. Given the reward matrix Rh and \u2126h \u2282 S \u00d7 A, recall the notation for the sub-matrix R\u2126hh of Rh. If sup\u03a0 P \u03a0(\u2126\u2201h) < \u03f5 have: 1. R\u2126hh is (\u00b50, \u00b51) incoherent. 2. |\u2126\u2201h| \u2264 |S| 2 The incoherence assumption for R\u2126h makes sense since the set \u2126 \u2201 cannot be easily reached with any policy with a probability larger than \u03f5. In fact we can arrive at an \u03f5 optimal policy for the original reward by just setting the rewards at \u2126\u2201 to be 0. These can be thought of as redundant states which do not matter for our RL model with any reward. Theorem 1. Suppose Assumption (Tab) 1, 2 hold. Let the parameter p = C max(\u00b521,\u00b50)r(N+|S||A|) log 2 |S||A| log(H\u03b4 ) N |S||A| . Then, with probability at-least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, we can find an \u03f5 optimal policy \u03a0\u0302u for every user u \u2208 [N ] whenever the total number of trajectories queried is: C |S||A|H2 ( |S|+ log( 1\u03b4 ) ) \u03f52 polylog( |S||A|H\u03f5 )+ Cmax(\u00b521, \u00b50)r(N + |S||A|)H log 2 |S||A| log(H\u03b4 ) \u03f5 Remark 1. Note that whenever N is very large, the number of trajectories queried per user is O\u0303( rH log 2(|S||A|) \u03f5 ), which is an exponential improvement in the state-space size dependence when compared to the minimax rate of |S||A|H 2 \u03f52 (Dann & Brunskill, 2015). Every phase in the algorithm has polynomial computational complexity in N, |S||A| and 1\u03f5 . 4.2 LINEAR MDP: Assumption (Lin) 2. There exists a \u03b3 > 0 such that for every x \u2208 Sd\u22121, and every h \u2208 [H] there exists a policy \u03a0x,h such that whenever S1:H , A1:H \u223c \u03a0x,h, E\u27e8\u03d5(Sh, Ah), x\u27e92 \u2265 \u03b3 The assumption above posits that for every fixed x \u2208 Rd, there exists a policy which can can have a good overlap with it. Suppose this does not hold for any \u03b3, then \u03d5(Sh, Ah) does not have any component in some direction x0 with any policy. This allows us to remove the sub-space spanned by x0 and make the embedding space Rd\u22121 at time h. Assumption (Lin) 3. There exist \u03b6, \u03be > 0 such that for every h \u2208 [H], there exists a policy \u03a0h,\u03b6,\u03be \u2208 Q such that whenever S1:H , A1:H \u223cM(\u03a0h,\u03b6,\u03be), we have: inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 E [ |\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e9| \u221a d\u2212 \u03bed\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e92 ] \u2265 \u03b6 The assumption above there exist measurements \u03c8(Sh, Ah) which are conducive to low rank matrix estimation as considered in Section 6. Assumption (Lin) 4. For any 1 \u2265 \u03b7 > 0, there exists an \u03b7 net for Q, denoted by Q\u0302\u03b7 such that log |Q\u0302\u03b7| \u2264 D log( 1\u03b7 ). We refer to Section A for construction of such policy classes withD = O(dH log dH log log(|A|)). We also demonstrate that deterministic policies which are sufficient for reward maximization (as used in Jin et al. (2020b)) cannot be used in this context. Theorem 2. Suppose Assumption (Lin) 1 2 3 and 4 hold and suppose \u03f5 < \u03b32 . In Algorithm 2, we set \u03ba = CC\u00b5dH \u221a dH+D( \u221a d+\u03bed) \u03b6 \u221a log ( C\u00b5H(d+D) \u03b6\u03b3\u03b4 ) and T = C \u03ba 2d \u03b32 log d\u03ba \u03b3 . Then, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, our algorithm finds \u03f5 optimal policy for every user u \u2208 [N ] with the total number of trajectories being bounded by: Trf + Tpol + Tmat\u2212comp, where: Trf = dH5(d+log( 1 \u03b4 )) \u03f52 + d9/2H6 log4( 1 \u03b4 ) \u03f5 , Tpol = C2\u00b5d 5H3(dH+D) log2 ( C\u00b5H(d+D) \u03b6\u03b3\u03b4 ) \u03b62\u03b32 Tmat\u2212comp = C Hr(N+d logN) log d \u03b6\u03be+H logN log( log N \u03b4 ) \u03b62\u03be2 Remark 2. Note that wheneverN is large, we have the the sample complexity per user to beO(Hr). This is much better than the dependence of \u2126(d2H2) in the minimax lower bounds for Linear MDPs (Wagenmaker et al., 2022). While Phases 1 and 2 of the algorithm have a computational complexity which is polynomial in d and 1\u03f5 , the optimization problems posed in Phase 3 and 4 are not necessarily polynomial time. We leave the computational aspects to future work 5 OBTAINING POLICIES WITH GIVEN STATISTICS: In this section, we consider the Linear MDP setting and describe the sub-routine described in Step 2 of Phase 2 of the algorithm where we compute a policy \u03a0\u0302f,h such that the law of \u03d5(Sh, Ah) under this policy approximately satisfies the property given in Assumption 3. This is required in order to use the guarantees for low matrix estimation in Phase 3, which is described in Section 6. We first state a structural lemma which characterizes the law of Sh+1, Ah+1 under any policy \u03a0. Lemma 1. Consider any policy \u03a0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H\u22121, \u03c0H) to the MDP M. Let S1:H , A1:H \u223c M(\u03a0). Then for any bounded, measurable function g : S \u00d7A \u2192 R, we have: Eg(Sh+1, Ah+1) = d\u2211 i=1 \u03bdi \u222b g(s, a)d\u00b5ih(ds)\u03c0h+1(da|s) Where \u03bdi := \u27e8E\u03d5(Sh, Ah), ei\u27e9 We now want to estimate any statistic under any policy using available data, obtained from the output of Algorithm 2. Notice that the output of Algorithm 2 gives a sequence of random variables (\u03d5h1, s(h+1)1), . . . , (\u03d5hT , s(h+1)T ) \u2208 Rd \u00d7 S such that (s(h+1)l)Tl=1|(\u03d5hl)Tl=1 \u223c\u220fT l=1 (\u2211d i=1\u27e8\u03d5hl, ei\u27e9\u00b5hi(\u00b7) ) andG\u03d5,h := \u2211T t=1 \u03d5ht\u03d5 \u22ba ht. For any measurable function g : S\u00d7A \u2192 RK , \u03bd \u2208 Rd such that \u2225\u03bd\u2225 \u2264 1 and any randomized policy \u03a0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H) we define: 1. T1(g, \u03c01) = E \u222b g(S1, a)\u03c01(da|S1) 2. Th+1(g; \u03bd, \u03c0h+1) = \u2211d i=1\u27e8\u03bd, ei\u27e9 \u222b \u00b5ih(ds)\u03c0h+1(da|s)g(s, a) when h \u2264 H \u2212 1 3. E\u03bd1 (\u03a0) := \u2225T1(\u03d5, \u03c01)\u2212 \u03bd\u22251 4. E\u03bdh(\u03a0) = inf\u03bd1,...,\u03bdh\u22121\u2208Bd(1) F (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121, \u03bd) whenever h > 1 Define \u03b1ht,\u03bd = \u03d5 \u22ba htG \u22121 \u03d5,h\u03bd. We estimate these operators from data as follows: 1. T\u03021(g, \u03c01) = 1T \u2211T t=1 \u222b g(s1t, a)\u03c01(da|s1t) 2. T\u0302h+1(g, \u03bd, \u03c0h+1) = \u2211T t=1 \u03b1ht,\u03bd \u222b g(s(h+1)t, a)\u03c0h+1(da|s(h+1)t) 3. E\u0302\u03bd1 (\u03a0) := \u2225T\u03021(\u03d5, \u03c01)\u2212 \u03bd\u22251 4. E\u0302\u03bdh(\u03a0) = inf\u03bd1,...,\u03bdh\u22121\u2208Bd(1) F\u0302 (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121, \u03bd) whenever h > 1 Where, for h > 1 and \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121 \u2208 Bd(1), we have defined: 1. F (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121, \u03bdh) := E\u03bd11 (\u03a0) + \u2211h j=2 \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 2. F\u0302 (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121, \u03bdh) := E\u0302\u03bd11 (\u03a0) + \u2211h j=2 \u2225T\u0302j(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 Define f(s, a;x) := |\u27e8x, \u03c8(s, a)\u27e9| \u221a d\u2212 \u03bed\u27e8x, \u03c8(s, a)\u27e92. The output of our method is: 1. \u03a0\u0302f,1 = arg sup\u03a0=(\u03c01,...,\u03c0H)\u2208Q infx\u2208Sd\u22121 T\u03021(f(\u00b7;x), \u03c01) 2. (\u03a0\u0302f,h, \u03bd\u0302) = arg sup \u03bd\u2208B(1) \u03a0=(\u03c01,...,\u03c0H)\u2208Q infx\u2208Sd\u22121 T\u0302h(f(\u00b7;x); \u03bd, \u03c0h) whenever h > 1, subject to E\u0302\u03bd\u0302,h\u22121(\u03a0\u0302f,h) \u2264 \u03b70 3. Assign output: \u03a0\u0302\u03b6,\u03be,h = \u03a0\u0302f,h The idea behind this method is as follows. First, using the output of algorithm 2, we construct T\u0302h(g, \u03bd, \u03c0h), which approximates the functional Th(g, \u03bd, \u03c0h) uniformly for every \u03bd, \u03c0h. This is shown in Lemma 9 in the appendix. We will show in Theorem 3 that obtaining policies which can be used with the matrix completion routine reduces to picking a policy \u03a0f,h = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H) such that whenever S1:H , A1:H \u223c M(\u03a0f,h), we must have: E infx\u2208Sd\u22121 f(Sh, Ah;x) \u2265 \u03b6. Now, we use Lemma 1 to conclude that if such a policy exists, then there exist \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121 such that E\u03d5(Sj , Aj) = \u03bdj and infx\u2208Sd\u22121 Th(f(;x); \u03bdh, \u03c0h) \u2265 \u03b6. Since we only have sample access, we find such a policy approximately by optimizing using the estimates T\u0302 instead of the exact functional T as described above. Theorem 3. We condition on the event G\u03d5,h \u2265 \u03ba2I for every h \u2208 [H]. Let \u03ba, \u03b7, \u03b70 be such that for some small enough constants c0, c > 0 and a large enough constant C > 0: 1. \u03b7 \u2264 c \u03b6 C\u00b5dH( \u221a d+\u03bed)H \u221a \u03ba2 T ; \u03b70 = c0 \u03b6 C\u00b5( \u221a d+d\u03be) 2. \u03ba \u2265 C C\u00b5( \u221a d+\u03bed)dH \u03b6 \u221a log ( dH|Q\u0302\u03b7| \u03b4 ) + dH log ( d \u03b7 ) Recall the policy \u03a0\u0302f,h. Suppose the Assumption 3 holds. Then, with probability at-least 1 \u2212 \u03b44 we obtain the policy \u03a0\u0302f,h is such that whenever S1:H , A1:H \u223cM(\u03a0\u0302f,h), we have: E inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 f(Sh, Ah;x) \u2265 \u03b6 2 This implies that equation 2 is satisfied with \u03b6 replaced with \u03b6/2. 6 MATRIX ESTIMATION WITH ROW-WISE LINEAR MEASUREMENTS: In this section, we describe the active learning based low rank matrix estimation procedure. For an unknown rank r matrix \u0398\u2217 (corresponding to the reward matrix \u0398\u2217h in the definition of Linear MDPs) of dimensions N \u00d7 d, we are allowed to query samples of the form (ei, \u03c8, e\u22bai \u0398\u2217\u03c8) for any i \u2208 [N ] of our choice and \u03c8 = \u03c8(Sh, Ah) where S1:H , A1:H \u223c M(\u03a0MC,h), for some input policy \u03a0MC,h. This corresponds to running the MDP corresponding to user i, with the policy \u03a0MC,h and observing the reward at time h, given by \u27e8ei,\u0398\u2217h\u03a8(Sh, Ah)\u27e9. Our basic task is to estimate the matrix \u0398\u2217 from these samples with high-probability. 6.1 THE ESTIMATOR: Given any N \u00d7 d matrix \u2206, by \u2206\u22bai , we denote its i-th row. Given K \u2208 N, and a sequence of vectors \u03a8 = (\u03c8ik \u2208 Rd)i\u2208[N ],k\u2208[K]. L(\u2206,\u03a8) := 1 NK N\u2211 i=1 K\u2211 k=1 |\u27e8\u2206i, \u03c8ik\u27e9|2 We estimate \u0398\u2217 row-wise using the following iterative procedure, where recover some rows of \u0398\u2217 into \u0398\u0302 in each iteration and obtain the corresponding linear measurements of \u0398\u2217. Letting the set of unknown rows at iteration t to be I\u0304t\u22121 (with I\u03040 = [N ]). We draw a fresh sequence of vectors \u03a8(t) from some distribution, we then recover some rows I\u0304\u2201t \u2286 I\u0304t\u22121 of \u0398\u2217 and store them in \u0398\u0302. 1. Draw \u03a8(t) = (\u03c8(t)ik )k\u2208[Kt],i\u2208I\u0304t\u22121 , we obtain \u03b8 \u2217 ik = e \u22ba i \u0398 \u2217\u03c8 (t) ik . 2. Consider the loss function L(\u0398\u2212\u0398\u2217,\u03a8(t)) := 1 Kt|I\u0304t\u22121| \u2211 i\u2208I\u0304t\u22121 K\u2211 k=1 |\u27e8\u0398i, \u03c8(t)ik \u27e9 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2217 ik|2 . 3. Find a matrix \u0398 with rank \u2264 r such that L(\u0398\u2212\u0398\u2217,\u03a8(t)) = 0. 4. Initialize I\u0304t \u2190 \u2205. 5. For every i \u2208 I\u0304t\u22121, draw K fresh samples using \u03c8\u0303(t)i1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c8\u0303 (t) iK and compute\u2211K k=1 |\u27e8\u0398i, \u03c8\u0303 (t) ik \u27e9\u2212\u03b8\u2217ik|2. If \u2211K k=1 |\u27e8\u0398i, \u03c8\u0303 (t) ik \u27e9\u2212\u03b8\u2217ik|2 > 0 then add i to I\u0304t i.e., I\u0304t \u2190 I\u0304t\u222a{i}. 6. End routine when I\u0304t = \u2205. Suppose \u03c8ik are i.i.d random vectors such that there exist \u03b6, \u03be > 0 such that for any x \u2208 Rd, \u2225x\u2225 = 1 we have: \u2225\u03c8ik\u2225 \u2264 1 almost surely; E|\u27e8\u03c8ik, x\u27e9| \u2265 \u03b6\u221a d ; E\u03c8ik\u03c8\u22baik \u2264 1 d\u03be2 (2) Then we have the following theorem: Theorem 4. Assume that supi \u2225\u0398\u2217i \u2225 \u2264 C\u03b8 and that the distribution of \u03c8 (t) ik satisfies equation 2. SupposeKt|I\u0304t\u22121| = C r|I\u0304t\u22121|+dr\u03b62\u03be2 log d \u03b6\u03be +C log( log N\u03b4 ) \u03b62\u03be2 . With probability at-least 1\u2212\u03b4, the algorithm terminates after logN iterations and the output \u0398\u0302 satisfies \u0398\u0302 = \u0398\u2217. Therefore, with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b4, the sample complexity for estimation of \u0398\u2217 is: C r(N + d logN) \u03b62\u03be2 log d\u03b6\u03be + C logN log ( logN \u03b4 ) \u03b62\u03be2 We refer to Section F for the proof of this result. A MORE DISCUSSION REGARDING POLICY SPACE:  A.1 NECESSITY OF RANDOMIZED POLICIES: We will first show that randomized policies might be necessary in such contexts with a simple example and show that obtaining states which satisfy conditions like equation 2 goes beyond simple reward maximization. Suppose H = 1, S = {1} and A = {1, . . . , d}. We consider the embedding \u03c8(s, a) = ea. Suppose we want to obtain a policy \u03c0 such that whenever S1, A1 \u223c \u03c0, \u03bbmin(E\u03c8(S1, A1)\u03c8(S1, A1)\u22ba) is maximized (where \u03bbmin denotes the minimum eigenvalue). This is maximized when \u03c0(da|s) is chosen to be the uniform distribution over A and the corresponding value is 1/d. Note that whenever \u03c0 is a deterministic policy we will have \u03bbmin = 0 whenever d > 1. This is in contrast to reward maximization problems where, under general conditions, a deterministic optimal policy exists (See Theorem 1.7 in Agarwal et al. (2019)). If fact, we can also show that the policy which minimizes \u2225E\u03c8(S1, A1) \u2212 1d \u2211d a=1 ea\u2225 must also necessarily be random. In the case of linear MDPs, we can find such a deterministic optimal policy \u03a0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H) as \u03c0h(s) = arg supa\u27e8\u03c8(s, a), u\u2217h\u27e9 + \u27e8\u03d5(s, a), v\u2217h\u27e9 (Jin et al., 2020b). This reduces the problem to estimating the parameters u\u2217h, v \u2217 h even when the state-action space is an infinite set. However, when such policies are not guaranteed to exist, as in case of functional maximization required in Section 6, the set of all policies can be intractably large. This is the justification for picking a nice enough policy space denoted by Q. A.2 CONSTRUCTING POLICY SPACES: We consider any linear MDP satisfying the definition given in Section 2 and suppose A is finite. We consider the set of all probability distributions \u03c0h(a|s;u, v) \u221d exp(\u27e8\u03d5(s, a), u\u27e9+ \u27e8\u03c8(s, a), v\u27e9). We consider Qh = {\u03c0h(a|s, u, v) : u, v \u2208 Bd(R)}, We let our policy space be Q = {\u03a0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H) : \u03c0h \u2208 Qh}. Lemma 2. Consider the probability distribution over a finite set [|A|] give by p\u03b2(a) \u221d exp(\u03b2xa) for every a \u2208 [|A|] some xa \u2208 R+ and \u03b2 \u2208 R+. For any \u03f5 > 0 and random variable A \u223c p\u03b2 , we must have: P(xA < sup a xa \u2212 \u03f5) \u2264 |A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5) And ExA \u2265 (sup a xa \u2212 \u03f5)(1\u2212 |A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5)) Lemma 3. Let Q\u2217h(s, a) be the optimal action-value function for the MDP. Then the policy \u03a0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0h) given by \u03c0h(a|s) \u221d exp(\u03b2Q\u2217h(s, a)) is \u03f5H + H2|A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5) sub-optimal for any \u03f5 > 0 Proof. Consider the optimal value function defined by V \u2217h (s) = supaQ \u2217 h(s, a). Let Q\u0304h(s, a) denote the optimal action value function under the policy \u03a0 and let V\u0304 (s) = \u222b Q\u0304h(s, a)\u03c0h(da|s) denote the value at state s with the policy \u03a0. Clearly, we have: Q\u0304H(s, a) = Q\u2217H(s, a) = R(s, a). Q\u0304h(s, a) \u2265 Q\u2217h(s, a)\u2212 \u03b7 uniformly. Then we have V\u0304h(s) \u2265 \u222b Q\u2217h(s, a)\u03c0h(da|s)\u2212 \u03b7 \u2265 (sup a Q\u2217h(s, a)\u2212 \u03f5)(1\u2212 |A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5))\u2212 \u03b7 \u2265 sup a Q\u2217h(s, a)\u2212 \u03f5\u2212H|A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5)\u2212 \u03b7 = V \u2217h (s)\u2212 \u03f5\u2212H|A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5)\u2212 \u03b7 (3) In the second step, we have invoked Lemma 2. In the last step, we have used the fact thatQ\u2217h \u2208 [0, H] uniformly. Now, by the Bellman iteration, we have: Q\u2217h\u22121(s, a) = Rh\u22121(s, a) + Es\u2032\u223cPh\u22121(|s,a)V \u2217 h (s \u2032) \u2265 Rh\u22121(s, a) + Es\u2032\u223cPh\u22121(|s,a)V\u0304h(s \u2032)\u2212 \u03f5\u2212H|A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5)\u2212 \u03b7 = Q\u0304h\u22121(s, a)\u2212 \u03f5\u2212H|A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5)\u2212 \u03b7 (4) Therefore, by induction, we conclude that V\u03041(s) \u2265 V \u22171 (s)\u2212 \u03f5H \u2212H2|A| exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03f5) Therefore, by the definition of the value function, we conclude the claim. Now, by a simple extension of Proposition 2.3 in Jin et al. (2020b), we conclude that the optimal Q\u2217h function for any linear MDP can be written as: Q\u2217h(s, a) = \u27e8\u03c8(s, a), u\u2217h\u27e9+ \u27e8\u03d5(s, a), v\u2217h\u27e9 . Where \u2225u\u2217h\u22252 \u2264 \u221a d and \u2225v\u2217h\u2225\u221e \u2264 HC\u00b5. Observe that choosing \u03f5 = \u03b7 2H and \u03b2 = 2 log(2H|A|/\u03b7) \u03b7 will ensure that the randomized policy \u03a0 in the statement of Lemma 3 is \u03b7 optimal. Therefore, we can take R = 2dHC\u00b5 log(2H|A|/\u03b7) \u03b7 in the definition of Qh above and conclude that this includes every \u03b7 optimal policy for every MDP with embedding functions \u03d5, \u03c8. We will now bound the covering number. Recall the definition of the distance DQ(\u03a01,\u03a02) = suph\u2208[H] TV(\u03c0 (1) h , \u03c0 (2) h ). Therefore it is sufficient to obtain an \u03b7 cover for Qh (denoted by Q\u0302h,\u03b7) and then construct Q\u0302\u03b7 = {\u03a0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H) : \u03c0h \u2208 Q\u0302h,\u03b7\u2200h \u2208 [H]} = \u220fH h=1 Q\u0302h,\u03b7 . Lemma 4. \u03c0(|s;u, v) be as defined in the beginning of this Subsection. TV(\u03c0(\u00b7|s;u, v), \u03c0(\u00b7|s;u\u2032, v\u2032)) \u2264 1 2 (exp(2\u2225u\u2212 u\u2032\u22252 + 2\u2225v \u2212 v\u2032\u2225\u221e)\u2212 1) Proof. Denote \u03c0(a|s;u, v) by \u03c0(a) and \u03c0(a|s;u\u2032, v\u2032) by \u03c0\u2032(a). Consider the corresponding partition functions denoted by Z := \u2211 a\u2208A exp(\u27e8\u03c8(s, a), u\u27e9 + \u27e8\u03d5(s, a), v\u27e9) and Z \u2032 :=\u2211 a\u2208A exp(\u27e8\u03c8(s, a), u\u2032\u27e9+ \u27e8\u03d5(s, a), v\u2032\u27e9). We conclude that using Ho\u0308lder\u2019s inequality for \u27e8u\u2212u\u2032, \u03c8\u27e9 and \u27e8v \u2212 v\u2032, \u03d5\u27e9 that: exp(\u2212\u2225u\u2212 u\u2032\u22252 \u2212 \u2225v \u2212 v\u2032\u2225\u221e) \u2264 Z \u2032 Z \u2264 exp(\u2225u\u2212 u\u2032\u22252 + \u2225v \u2212 v\u2032\u2225\u221e) exp(\u22122\u2225u\u2212 u\u2032\u22252 \u2212 2\u2225v \u2212 v\u2032\u2225\u221e) \u2264 \u03c0\u2032(a) \u03c0(a) \u2264 exp(2\u2225u\u2212 u\u2032\u22252 + 2\u2225v \u2212 v\u2032\u2225\u221e) (5) TV(\u03c0, \u03c0\u2032) = 12 \u2211 a\u2208A |\u03c0(a)\u2212 \u03c0\u2032(a)| = 12 \u2211 a\u2208A \u03c0(a) \u2223\u22231\u2212 \u03c0\u2032(a)\u03c0(a) \u2223\u2223 \u2264 1 2 (exp(2\u2225u\u2212 u\u2032\u22252 + 2\u2225v \u2212 v\u2032\u2225\u221e)\u2212 1) (6) Using the lemma above, we conclude that Q\u0302h,\u03b7 = {\u03c0h(|s;u, v) : u, v \u2208 B\u0302d,\u03b7/4(R)} whenever \u03b7 \u2264 1. Here B\u0302d,\u03b7/4(R) an \u03b7/4 net over Bd(R) with respect to the norm \u2225 \u00b7 \u22252. From the results in Vershynin (2018), we can therefore take: |Q\u0302h,\u03b7| \u2264 |B\u0302d,\u03b7/4(R)|2 \u2264 exp(Cd log(C\u03b7R )) (7) Since we had Q\u0302\u03b7 = \u220fH h=1, we conclude that: log(|Q\u0302\u03b7|) \u2264 cdH ( log dH\u03b7 + log log(2H|A|/\u03b7) ) A.3 RELATIONSHIP TO MEANFIELD LIMITS OF MULTI-AGENT RL: Consider the conditions given in equation 2 for \u03c8(Sh, Ah) where S1:H , A1:H \u223c \u03a0mat\u2212comp,h. We refer to the proof of Theorem 3 to show that the following condition implies the conditions given in equation 2: inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 E|\u27e8\u03c8(Sh, Ah), x\u27e9| \u221a d\u2212 \u03bed\u27e8\u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e92 \u2265 \u03b6 Conversely, the conditions in equation 2 implies the following: inf x E|\u27e8\u03c8(Sh, Ah), x\u27e9| \u221a d\u2212 \u03be 2\u03b6 2 d\u27e8\u03c8(Sh, Ah), x\u27e92 \u2265 \u03b6 2 Therefore, the problem of obtaining a policy satisfying equation 2 reduces to finding a policy such that the functional infx E|\u27e8\u03c8(Sh, Ah), x\u27e9| \u221a d \u2212 \u03b2d\u27e8\u03c8(Sh, Ah), x\u27e92 is maximized for some small enough \u03b2 \u2208 R+. Note that this functional maps the distribution of (Sh, Ah) (denoted by \u0393h(\u03a0)) obtained by applying some policy \u03a0 to a real number. Let us denote this function by J(\u0393h). Our objective now is to find a policy \u03a0mat\u2212comp,h by solving the following optimization problem arg sup \u03a0\u2208Q J(\u0393h(\u03a0)) (8) This setup is similar to the mean field multi-agent control problem presented in Cammardella et al. (2020). To explicitly see the connection to Multi-agent systems, consider n agents with the same MDPM and embedding functions \u03d5, \u03c8. Each trajectory from this multi-agent system corresponds to jointly and running the MDP associated with each agent with the same policy independently. The collective reward of the system is given by J(\u0393\u0302h), where \u0393\u0302h denotes the empirical distribution of state-actions of the n agents at time h. Note that on the one hand, picking a policy \u03a0n to maximize this reward is a reward maximization problem on the joint multi-agent system. And, for any fixed policy \u03a0, as n \u2192 \u221e, \u0393\u0302h(\u03a0) \u2192 \u0393h(\u03a0) under reasonable assumptions on the state space via the law of large numbers and hence J(\u0393\u0302h(\u03a0)) \u2192 J(\u0393h(\u03a0)) under continuity. Therefore the planning problem in equation 8 is the same as the multi-agent planning problem described above in the limit n\u2192\u221e. B ANALYSIS - TABULAR MDPS: We will call the reward free RL procedure in Phase 1 to be successful if it outputs the \u03f5 optimal policy. This has probability atleast 1\u2212 \u03b42 . B.1 ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM 1: Lemma 5. Suppose p \u2264 12 , conditioned on the success of Phase 1, with probability at-least 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212cNp|S||A|H), Algorithm 1 terminates after querying C|S||A|NHp\u03f5 trajectories. (Gh)h\u2208[H], the active sets at the termination of the algorithm. They satisfy: sup \u03c0 H\u2211 h=1 P\u03c0h (Gh) \u2264 5\u03f5 8 (9) For any a \u00d7 b matrix R, let R\u0302 be its partially observed version (that is, there exists a set of indices I \u2286 [a] \u00d7 [b] such that R\u0302ij = Rij if (i, j) \u2208 I and R\u0302ij = \u2217 otherwise). We call a random set of indices J to have the distribution Unif(m, [a], [b]) if J is drawn uniformly at random such that |J | = m. Lemma 6 (Modification: Mod1). Suppose we run, independently, a modification of algorithm 1 where on the \u201cQuery trajectory\u201d step the trajectories are sampled from a fixed MDP M1 (but rewards are from the reward function corresponding to Ut). Consider all the random variables that determine the trajectory of this algorithm: ( V\u0302 , \u03a0\u0302, (S (t) 1:H , A (t) 1:H , R (t) 1:H)t, (Ut)t ) . Then the joint distribution of this collection of random variables is unchanged under the modification. Proof. The proof follows from an induction argument on the time index t. We describe the key steps here. For the ease of notation, let Tt = ( (S (t) 1:H , A (t) 1:H , R (t) 1:H), Ut ) Let XT = ( V\u0302 , \u03a0\u0302, (Tt)t\u2264T ) . Let X\u0303T and T\u0303t denote the corresponding quantities under the modification. It is enough to show that finite dimensional marginals have the same joint distribution under the modification. In particular, we will show: 1. T0 d = T\u03030 2. Suppose XT d = X\u0303T . Then the Markov kernel kTT+1|XT is almost surely (under the com- mon distribution of XT , X\u0303T ) equal to kT\u0303T+1|X\u0303T . Thus XT+1 d = X\u0303T+1 The first statement is straightforward since, in the zeroth step, the distribution of \u03a0\u0302G not affected by the modification, and thus due to identical MDP transitions across users, the distribution of T0 is preserved under modification. A similar argument proves the second statement. Roughly, given a realization of XT the distribution of TT+1 is same as the distribution of T\u0303T+1 given the same realization of X\u0303T , due to the exact same reason presented for the first statement. A fully formal proof requires setting up appropriate proability spaces, so we omit it here. Furthermore, since the random variables considered are all discrete, one can argue via PMFs as well. Lemma 7. Suppose p \u2264 12 . conditioned on the success of Phase 1 and termination of Algorithm 1, for every h \u2208 [H], the Algorithm 1 returns partially filled reward matrices R\u0302h. Consider the sub-matrix R\u0302G \u2201 h h . Let Ih \u2286 [N ] \u00d7 G\u2201h be the sub-set of observed indices for R\u0302h. Let Jh|Gh \u223c Unif(Np|G \u2201 h| 2 , [N ],G \u2201 h). There exists a coupling between Jh and Ih such that P ( Jh \u2286 Ih \u2223\u2223Gh) \u2265 1\u2212 |S||A| exp(\u2212cNp) Proof. Let us fix Gh and construct a coupling between Ih and Jh. Consider any fixed, arbitrary permutations \u03c3g over [N ], for g \u2208 G\u2201h. By \u03c3(Ih), we denote {(\u03c3g(i), g) : (i, g) \u2208 Ih}. Claim 1. Conditioned on Gh, \u03c3(Ih) has the same distribution as Ih. Proof. Let {\u03c3(s,a):[N ]\u2192[N ]|(s, a) \u2208 S\u00d7A} be a set of arbitrary permutations on [N ]. From lemma 6 it is enough to prove the statement for the random variables under the modification described in that lemma (call this Mod1). Now consider a further modification (call it Mod2) where in every iteration t, we sample Ut \u223c Unif([N ]), for each horizon h we set U\u0303 (t)h = \u03c3(S(t)h ,A(t)h )(Ut), and then update the entries of Rh(U\u0303 (t) h , (S (t) h , A (t) h )) (instead of Rh(Ut, (S (t) h , A (t) h ))). Next, we couple these two modifications by using same (V\u0302 , \u03a0\u0302) and the same set of Ut\u2019s for both the modifications. Further, we couple the MDP used in these modifications to be the same, single MDP. Now an induction argument shows that the sequence of active sets G obtained in these modifications are also identical for every time t; only the rows of Rh where entries are filled change according to the set of permutations chosen.Thus, under the described coupling, Mod1 and Mod2 produce identical trajectories (i.e., (S(t)1:H , A (t) 1:H)), the columns of reward matrices are just permutations of each other described by the chosen set of permutations, and algorithm 1 terminate at the same time in both these cases. However, the same induction argument also shows that for each t and h, conditioned on Gh, trajectories (which is same in Mod1 and Mod2) until at beginning of iteration t, we have (Ut, (S (t) h , A (t) h )) d = (U\u0303 (t) h , (S (t) h , A (t) h )). Therefore if Ih, I\u0303h \u2282 [N ] \u00d7 G\u2201h denotes the subset of observed indices at termination (outside the active set), then I\u0303h = \u03c3(Ih) \u2261 {(\u03c3(s,a)(i), (s, a)) : (i, (s, a) \u2208 Ih)} and, conditioned on Gh, I\u0303h d = Ih Claim 2. At termination, conditioned on Gh, random sets Igh = {(i, g) : (i, g) \u2208 Ih} are jointly independent. Proof. Again we work with the modification Mod1 described in lemma 6. For each (s, a) consider the collection of Ut\u2019s that are used populate the column (s, a) of matrix Rh in algorithm 1. Call this collection U(s,a). Remark 3. Since the columns of Ih have exactly Np entries, permutation invariance proved in the above claim implies that For any set J\u0304 \u2286 [N ]\u00d7G\u2201h, define the count function (N J\u0304g )g\u2208G\u2201h such that N J\u0304 g = |{i \u2208 [N ] : (i, g) \u2208 J\u0304}|. We are now ready to give the coupling: given Gh, draw uniformly random, independent permutations \u03c3g for g \u2208 G\u2201h. Draw (Ng)g\u2208G\u2201h independent of \u03c3g and to have the joint law of (N Jh g )g\u2208G\u2201h . Define: J\u0303h = {(\u03c3g(i), g) : i \u2264 Ng, g \u2208 G\u2201h} I\u0303h = {(\u03c3g(i), g) : i \u2264 Np, g \u2208 G\u2201h} Claim 3. J\u0303h and I\u0303h have the correct marginal distributions Proof. First we will prove a general statement about J \u223c Unif(r, [N ], [M ]). Let X \u2208 {0, 1}N\u00d7M withXi,m = 1 iff (i,m) \u2208 J . Let (Nm)m\u2208[M ] be the count functions corresponding to J i.e.,Nm =\u2211 iXi,m. Let Ym = (X1,m, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , XN,m). We will argue that conditional on {Nm : m \u2208 [M ]}, the random vectors Ym are jointly independent. Indeed, pick any x \u2208 {0, 1}N\u00d7M and (n1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , nm). Let ym be the m\u2019th column of x. Then P [X = x,\u2229m{Nm = nm}] = (\u220f m 1 [\u2211 i xi,m = nm ]) 1 \u2211 i,m xi,m = r  1( MN r ) The above can also be written as P [\u2229m{Ym = ym},\u2229m{Nm = nm}] = (\u220f m 1 [\u2211 i xi,m = nm ]) 1 [\u2211 m nm = r ] 1( MN r ) Let 1 denote the all 1 vector in RN . Note that ym = (x1,m, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xN,m)\u22a4. Marginalizing the above, we see that P [\u2229m{Nm = nm}] = (\u220f m 1( N nm )) 1[\u2211 m nm = r ] 1( MN r ) Thus the conditional distribution can be expressed as P [ \u2229m{Ym = ym} \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2229m {Nm = nm}] = (\u220f m 1 [ 1\u22a4ym = nm ]( N nm ) ) 1 [\u2211m nm = r]( MN r ) Since the (conditional) joint PMF factors, it is an easy calculation to show the conditional independence i.e., P [ \u2229m{Ym = ym} \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2229m {Nm = nm}] =\u220f m P [ Ym = ym \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2229m {Nm = nm}] Furthermore, for any n1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7nm such that \u2211 m nm = r, marginalization shows P [Ym = ym| \u2229m {Nm = nm}] = 1 [ 1\u22a4ym = nm ]( N nm ) Let N\u2212m = (N1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nm\u22121, Nm+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , NM ), and similarly for n\u2212m. Then P [Ym = ym, N\u2212m = n\u2212m|Nm = nm] = P [Ym = ym| \u2229m {Nm = nm}]P [N\u2212m = n\u2212m|Nm = nm] = 0, \u2211 m nm \u0338= r 1[1\u22a4ym=nm] ( Nnm) P [N\u2212m = n\u2212m|Nm = nm] , otherwise The above factorization directly implies that Ym, conditioned on Nm is uniformly distributed on its support {y : 1\u22a4y = Nm} and is independent of N\u2212m. Thus P [ \u2229m{Ym = ym} \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2229m {Nm = nm}] = \u220f m P [ Ym = ym \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Nm = nm] = \u220f m 1 [ 1\u22a4ym = nm ]( N nm ) Observation: The above calculations give another way to generate Y : first generate N1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , NM from the right distribution, and then conditioned on Nm generate each Ym uniformly such that 1\u22a4Ym = Nm. Next we apply the above calculations and observation to J = Jh|Gh \u223c Unif(Np|G \u2201 h| 2 , [N ],G \u2201 h). For a uniformly random permutation \u03c3 on [N ], the set {\u03c3(i) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k} is uniformly distributed on all k-sized subsets of [N ]. In the statement of the claim the permutations are chosen independently for each g \u2208 G\u2201c . Thus from the above observation, we have Jh d = J\u0303h conditioned on Gh. The claim about I\u0303h follows directly from permutation invariance proved by claim 1. Claim 4. P(Ng > Np|Gh) \u2264 exp(\u2212c0Np) for every g \u2208 G\u2201h Proof. Throughout this proof, we will condition on the terminal active set Gh. We will show this using the results on concentration with negative regression property as established in Proposition 29 in Dubhashi & Ranjan (1996). Ng = \u2211N i=1 1((i, g) \u2208 J\u0303h). Now we will show that the collection Xig := 1((i, g) \u2208 J\u0303h) for i \u2208 [N ], g \u2208 G\u2201h satisfy the negative regression property. By the definition of negative regression, we can conclude that the sub-collection (Xig)i\u2208[N ] also satisfies this property for every g \u2208 G\u2201h. Consider the partial order over binary vectors X \u2ab0 Y iff Xl \u2265 Yl for every l. The negative regression property is satisfied iff for every K1,K2 \u2286 [N ] \u00d7 G\u2201h such that K1 \u2229 K2 = \u2205, and a real valued function f(Xm : m \u2208 K1) which is non-decreasing with respect to the partial order, we must have: g(tl : l \u2208 K2) := E [ f(Xm : m \u2208 K1) \u2223\u2223Xl = tl,\u2200l \u2208 K2] be such that g is a non-increasing function in tl with respect to the partial order. Note that in the case of uniform distribution as in J\u0303h, the distribution (Xm)m\u2208K1 is the uniform, permutation invariant distribution with constant sum almost surely. The sum being Np|G \u2201 h| 2 \u2212 \u2211 l\u2208K2 tl. Therefore, whenever t\u2032l \u2265 tl for every l \u2208 K2, we have the following stochastic dominance:[ (Xm)m\u2208K1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Xl = t\u2032l\u2200l \u2208 K2] \u2aaf [(Xm)m\u2208K1\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Xl = tl\u2200l \u2208 K2] Therefore, this coupling leads us to conclude that: g(tl : l \u2208 K2) := E [ f(Xm : m \u2208 K1) \u2223\u2223Xl = tl\u2200l \u2208 K2] \u2265 E [ f(Xm : m \u2208 K1) \u2223\u2223Xl = t\u2032l\u2200l \u2208 K2] = g(t\u2032l : l \u2208 K2) (10) The second step follows from stochastic dominance. This implies that the function g is nonincreasing which establishes the negative regression property. Now, we consult Proposition 29 in Dubhashi & Ranjan (1996) to show that we can take Chernoff bounds on Ng = \u2211 i\u2208[N ]Xig as though Xig were i.i.d Ber(p). Therefore, from an application of Bernstein\u2019s inequality (Boucheron et al., 2013), we conclude the statement of the claim. Now, Jh \u2286 Ih if and only if Ng \u2264 Np for every g \u2208 G\u2201h. Therefore, from the claim above, we have P(Jh \u2286 Ih|G\u2201h) \u2265 1\u2212 |S||A| exp (\u2212c0Np). We are now ready to prove Theorem 1. Proof of Theorem 1. In order to establish the result, we need to show that with p as set in the statement, the algorithm returns \u03f5 optimal policies \u03a0\u0302u for every user u \u2208 [N ] with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b4. The total sample complexity is the number of trajectories queried in Phase 1 plus the number of trajectories queried in Phase 2. Phase 1 queries Krf( \u03f58 , \u03b4 2 ) trajectories, which is C |S||A|H2 ( |S|+log( 1\u03b4 ) ) \u03f52 polylog( |S||A|H \u03f5 ) by the results of Zhang et al. (2020). By Lemma 5, we conclude that the sample complexity of phase 2 is C|S||A|NHp\u03f5 and with the value of p given in the statement of the theorem, this succeeds with probability at-least 1 \u2212 \u03b44 when conditioned on the success of Phase 1. We will show that conditioned on the success of Phase 2, with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b44 , the nuclear norm minimization algorithm of Recht (2011) successfully obtains RG \u2201 h h . Indeed by Theorem 1 in Recht (2011), we see that whenever co-ordinates of RG \u2201 h h corresponding to random indices drawn from Unif(m, [N ],G\u2201h) are observed with m = C1 max(\u00b521, \u00b50)r(N + |G\u2201h|) log 2 |G\u2201h| log(H\u03b4 ), the algorithm succeeds at recovering RG \u2201 h h with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b4 8H . The number of co-ordinates we observe is Np|G\u2201h| \u2265 Np|SA| 2 \u2265 2C1 max(\u00b521, \u00b50)r(N + |G\u2201h|) log 2 |G\u2201h| log(H\u03b4 ) In the last step, we have used Assumption 2 to conclude that |G\u2201h| \u2265 |S||A| 2 . For the constant C in the definition of p large enough, we must have: m \u2264 Np|G \u2201 h| 2 Note that the results of Recht (2011) requires at-least m observations to be chosen uniformly at random co-ordinates, but we do not obtain observations which are uniformly at uniformly random co-ordinates. Here, we will use the results of Lemma 7. Let Jh be a fictitious subset of co-ordinates distributed as Unif(m, [N ],G\u2201h) when conditioned on G\u2201h. If the observed co-ordinates are Jh, then we can successfully estimate the reward matrixRh with proability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b48H in this case. Now, suppose that the actually observed co-ordinates are Ih, which is a strict super-set of Jh. Then we check that the matrix completion algorithm, which is based on constrained nuclear-norm minimization, still succeeds with observed co-ordinates corresponding to Ih whenever it succeeds with the observed co-ordinates correspond to Jh. We now refer to the coupling in Lemma 7, which shows that we can couple Jh to the real distribution Ih such that Jh \u2286 Ih with probability at-least 1 \u2212 \u03b48H When the constant C1 in the definition of p is large enough, we conclude by invoking Lemma 7 that: Jh \u2286 Ih with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b48H . Applying union bound for h \u2208 [H], we conclude that Phase 3 succeeds with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b44 when conditioned on the success of Phases 1 and 2. Therefore, from the arguments above, we conclude that Phases 1,2 and 3 succeed with probability at-least 1\u2212\u03b4 and give us the reward matricesRG \u2201 h h where the sets satisfy the following equation from Lemma 5. sup \u03c0 H\u2211 h=1 P\u03c0h (Gh) \u2264 5\u03f5 8 (11) It now remains to show that we obtain \u03f5 optimal policies for each user after Phase 4. Note that whenever Phase 1 succeeds, we can compute \u03f5/4 optimal policies for every possible reward function bounded in [0, 1]. Since we do not know the rewards over the set Gh, we set it to zero as described in the algorithm to obtain R\u0304h. It remains to show that planning with R\u0304h and using it with the reward free RL algorithm gives us an \u03f5 optimal policy. Suppose \u03a0\u2217u is the optimal policy for user u and suppose \u03a0\u0304u be the optimal policy for user u under rewards R\u0304h(u, (s, a)). Note that combined with the guarantees for the reward free RL, in order to complete the proof of the theorem, it is sufficient to show that the policy \u03a0\u0304u is 3\u03f5/4 optimal with respect to the actual rewards Rh(u, (s, a)). Let S\u22171:H , A \u2217 1:H \u223cM(\u03a0\u2217u) and S\u03041:H , A\u03041:H \u223cM(\u03a0\u0304u). E H\u2211 h=1 Rh(u, (S \u2217 h, A \u2217 h)) \u2264 E H\u2211 h=1 Rh(u, (S \u2217 h, A \u2217 h))1((S \u2217 h, A \u2217 h) \u2208 G\u2201h) + 1((S\u2217h, A\u2217h) \u2208 Gh) = E H\u2211 h=1 R\u0304h(u, (S \u2217 h, A \u2217 h)) + 1((S \u2217 h, A \u2217 h) \u2208 Gh) = E H\u2211 h=1 R\u0304h(u, (S \u2217 h, A \u2217 h)) + H\u2211 h=1 P\u03a0 \u2217 h (Gh) \u2264 E H\u2211 h=1 R\u0304h(u, (S \u2217 h, A \u2217 h) + 5\u03f5 8 \u2264 E H\u2211 h=1 R\u0304h(u, (S\u0304h, A\u0304h) + 5\u03f5 8 \u2264 E H\u2211 h=1 Rh(u, (S\u0304h, A\u0304h) + 5\u03f5 8 (12) In the first step we have used the fact that the rewards are uniformly bounded in [0, 1]. In the second step, we have used the definition of R\u0304h(u, (s, a)) := Rh(u, (s, a))1((s, a) \u2208 G\u2201h). In the third step, we have used the guarantee in equation 11. In the fourth step, we have used the fact that P\u0304 i maximizes the reward R\u0304h. In the fifth step, we have used the fact that Rh(u, (s, a)) \u2265 R\u0304h(u, (s, a)) uniformly. From the discussion above, this concludes the proof of the theorem. C ANALYSIS - LINEAR MDPS: Lemma 8. Suppose Assumption 2 holds. Let \u03ba > 1 and T \u2265 C d\u03ba 2 (\u03b3\u2212\u03f5)2 log d\u03ba \u03b3\u2212\u03f5 . With probability atleast 1\u2212H exp(\u2212c(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5)T ), the output of Algorithm 2 returns \u03d5th such that \u2211T t=1 \u03d5th\u03d5 \u22ba th \u2ab0 \u03ba2I for every h \u2208 [H] Proof of Theorem 2. By Theorem 1 in Wagenmaker et al. (2022), we take Krf(\u03f5, \u03b4/4) = CdH5(d+log( 1 \u03b4 )) \u03f52 + Cd9/2H6 log4( 1 \u03b4 ) \u03f5 . Phase 1 succeeds with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4 4 . Note that this is the quantity Trf in the statement of the theorem. We now condition on the success of Phase 1. The number of trajectories queried by Algorithm 2 which is given by HT = Tpol. By Lemma 8, we conclude that for the given values of T and \u03ba, this algorithm successfully outputs \u03d5ht such that G\u03d5,h \u2ab0 \u03ba2I for every h \u2208 [H], with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b44 . Now, condition on the success of Algorithm 2. By theorem 3, we conclude that with these conclude that with proabability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b44 , with the values of the given parameters, for every h \u2208 [H], the procedure in Step 2 of Phase 2 outputs a policy \u03a0\u0302f,h such that whenever S1:H , A1:H \u223c M(\u03a0\u0302f,h), the conditions in equation 2 is satisfied for the random vector \u03c8(Sh, Ah) with \u03b6 replaced by \u03b6/2. We then use the active learning based matrix completion procedure given in Section 6, where the vectors \u03c8jk are sample using the policy \u03a0\u0302f,h on the given user. By theorem 4, we conclude that conditioned on the success of all the steps above, with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b44 , we can exactly estimate each of the matrices \u0398\u2217h for h \u2208 [H] with Tmat\u2212comp number of samples. Upon the success of Phases 1, 2, 3 (which occurs with probability at-least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 by union bound), we conclude that Phase 4 gives the \u03f5 optimal policy for each user u \u2208 [N ] because of the guarantees of reward free RL. D DEFERRED PROOFS:  D.1 PROOF OF LEMMA 5: Proof. We suppose that the reward free RL in Phase 1 succeeds and returns the \u03f58 optimal policy for every choice of rewards bounded in [0, 1]. The algorithm terminates whenever the active sets are such that V\u0302 (J (;G)) \u2264 \u03f5 2 (13) Note that by the definition of J (;G), the maximum value for the MDP with reward J (;G) is sup\u03a0 \u2211H h=1 P \u03a0(Gh). Since V\u0302 is the output of the reward free RL algorithm, we conclude that we have: |V\u0302 (J (;G))\u2212 sup \u03a0 H\u2211 h=1 P\u03a0h (Gh)| \u2264 \u03f5 8 (14) We conclude via equation 13 and equation 14 that equation 9 holds, which establishes the second part of the theorem. We now consider the termination time. Suppose G(t) is the sequence of active sets before termination at step t (i.e, it satisfies V\u0302 (J (;G(t))) > \u03f52 ). Recall \u03a0\u0302, the output of the reward free RL algorithm. It follows from the guarantees for reward free RL that: | H\u2211 h=1 P \u03a0\u0302 G h (G (t) h )\u2212 sup \u03a0 H\u2211 h=1 P\u03a0h (G (t) h )| \u2264 \u03f5 8 Combining this with Equation equation 14 and the fact that V\u0302 (J (;G(t))) > \u03f52 , we conclude: H\u2211 h=1 P \u03a0\u0302 G h (G (t) h ) \u2265 \u03f5 4 (15) We consider the potential function with \u03c6(0) = 0 and \u03c6(t) = \u2211 h\u2208[H] \u2211 (s,a)\u2208S\u00d7A T (t) h,(s,a), where T (t) h,(s,a) is the counter Th,(s,a) inside Algorithm 1 at the beginning of the step t. Whenever G(t) is such that V\u0302 (J (;G(t))) > \u03f52 , we define Nt := \u03c6(t + 1) \u2212 \u03c6(t) (i.e, before termination). Just for the sake of theoretical arguments, we define the fictious random variables Nt = Ber( \u03f5 8 ) i.i.d after termination. Let Ft = \u03c3(G (s), S (s) 1:H , A (s) 1:H , R (s) 1:H , U (s) : s \u2264 t) Claim 5. The following relations hold: 1. E [Nt|Ft] \u2265 \u03f58 2. E [ N2t |Ft ] \u2264 E[Nt|Ft]H4 3. |Nt| \u2264 H almost surely. Proof. The inequalities are clear when G(t) is such that V\u0302 (J (;G(t))) \u2264 \u03f52 . Now consider the case V\u0302 (J (;G(t))) > \u03f52 . By definition, conditioned on this event, we have almost surely: Nt = H\u2211 h=1 1((S (t) h , A (t) h ) \u2208 G (t) h ).1(R\u0302 (t) h (Ut, (S (t) h , A (t) h )) = \u2217) That is, we increment the Th,(s,a) only when we encounter an element of the active set such that the entry for this user has not been observed before. Observe that for any arbitrary (s, a) \u2208 S \u00d7A P ( R\u0302 (t) h (Ut, (s, a)) = \u2217 \u2223\u2223Ft, (S(t)h , A(t)h ) = (s, a)) = |{u : R\u0302(t)h (s, a) = \u2217}|N . (16) This is true since the law of S(t)h , A (t) h is independent of Ut (since all users share the same MDP), when conditioned on Ft. Now, the algorithm only fills the column corresponding to (s, a) until the number of entries is smaller than Np \u2264 N2 . We conclude that: |{u : R\u0302(t)(h, (s, a)) = \u2217}| \u2265 N \u2212Np \u2265 N 2 . This allows us to conclude P ( R\u0302 (t) h (Ut, (s, a)) = \u2217 \u2223\u2223Ft, (S(t)h , A(t)h ) = (s, a)) \u2265 12 and hence: ENt = H\u2211 h=1 E1((S(t)h , A (t) h ) \u2208 G (t) h ).1(R (t) h (Ut, (S (t) h , A (t) h )) = \u2217) \u2265 1 2 H\u2211 h=1 E1((S(t)h , A (t) h ) \u2208 G (t) h ) = 1 2 H\u2211 h=1 P \u03a0\u0302 G h (G (t) h ) \u2265 \u03f5 8 (17) In the last step we have used equation 15. The bound |Nt| \u2264 H almost surely follows from definition. Now note that E [ N2t |Ft ] \u2264 HE [Nt|Ft]. Claim 6. For any \u03c4 \u2208 N and some c0 > 0 small enough, we have: P ( \u03c4\u22121\u2211 t=0 Nt < \u03f5\u03c4 16 ) \u2264 exp(\u2212c0 \u03f5\u03c4H ) Proof. For 34H > \u03bb > 0, consider Mt = \u2212 \u03bb2E[N2t |Ft] 1\u2212\u03bbH3 + \u03bb (E [Nt|Ft]\u2212Nt). Now consider: E exp( \u03c4\u22121\u2211 t=0 Mt) = E [ E [exp(M\u03c4\u22121)|F\u03c4\u22121] exp ( \u03c4\u22121\u2211 t=0 Mt )] = E [exp(\u03bbE [N\u03c4\u22121|F\u03c4\u22121]\u2212 \u03bbNt)|F\u03c4\u22121] exp ( \u03c4\u22122\u2211 t=0 Mt ) exp ( \u2212\u03bb 2E[N2\u03c4\u22121|F\u03c4\u22121] 1\u2212\u03bbH3 ) \u2264 E exp ( \u2212\u03bb 2E[N2\u03c4\u22121|F\u03c4\u22121] 1\u2212\u03bbH3 ) exp ( \u03c4\u22122\u2211 t=0 Mt ) exp ( \u2212\u03bb 2E[N2\u03c4\u22121|F\u03c4\u22121] 1\u2212\u03bbH3 ) = E exp( \u03c4\u22122\u2211 t=0 Mt) (18) In the first step we have used the fact that \u2211\u03c4\u22122 t=0 Mt is F\u03c4\u22121 measurable and the towering property of conditional expectation. In the third step, we have used the exponential moment bound given in Exercise 2.8.5 in Vershynin (2018), as applied to N\u03c4 \u2212 E [N\u03c4\u22121|F\u03c4\u22121] along with the fact that Nt \u2208 [0, H] almost surely. From equation 18, we conclude that E exp( \u2211\u03c4 t=0Mt) \u2264 1 and thus applying the Chernoff bound, we conclude that for any \u03b2 > 0 P ( \u03c4\u22121\u2211 t=0 \u2212\u03bbE[N 2 t |Ft] 1\u2212\u03bbH3 + (E [Nt|Ft]\u2212Nt) > \u03b2 ) \u2264 exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03b2) Now, using item 2 from Claim 5, we conclude that P ( \u03c4\u22121\u2211 t=0 Nt < \u2212\u03b2 + 3\u22124\u03bbH3\u2212\u03bbH \u03c4\u22121\u2211 t=0 E [Nt|Ft] ) \u2264 exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03b2) Now, using item 1 from Claim 5, we note that \u2211\u03c4\u22121 t=0 E [Nt|Ft] \u2265 \u03f5\u03c4 8 almost surely. Setting \u03bb = 1 4H and \u03b2 = c0\u03f5\u03c4 for some small enough constant \u03f5, we conclude: P ( \u03c4\u22121\u2211 t=0 Nt < \u03f5\u03c4 16 ) \u2264 exp(\u2212c0 \u03f5\u03c4H ) Let \u03c4 term denote the termination time for the algorithm. This is true since \u03c6(t) is increasing in t, \u03c6(t) \u2264 NpH|S||A|, and strict inequality holds when t < \u03c4 term. For every \u03c4 < \u03c4 term we have \u03c6(\u03c4) = \u2211\u03c4\u22121 t=0 N\u03c4 < NpH|S||A|. Therefore, we have the following relationship between the events: {\u03c4 term > \u03c4} \u2286 { \u03c4\u2211 t=1 N\u03c4 < Np|S||A|H } Setting \u03c4 = 16Np|S||A|H\u03f5 , we have: P(\u03c4 term > \u03c4) \u2264 P ( \u03c4\u2211 t=1 N\u03c4 < Np|S||A|H ) \u2264 exp(\u2212cNp|S||A|) D.2 PROOF OF LEMMA 8: Proof. By Remark 4.3 in Wagenmaker et al. (2022), we show that non-linear rewards can be handled by the reward free RL algorithm in Phase 1 as long all the reward are uniformly bounded in [0, 1]. Let Bth be the matrix I+A\u03d5 in Algorithm 2 at step t for horizon h. Similarly, let the corresponding projection Q be Qth. Recall that Qth is the projection onto an eigenspace of Bth. Now, suppose S1:H , A1:H \u223cMUt(\u03a0\u0302Qt,h) as in the algorithm. Let \u03d5th := \u03d5(Sh, Ah). Now, if Qth \u0338= 0, then: \u03d5\u22bathB \u22121 th \u03d5th \u2265 \u03d5 \u22ba thQthB \u22121 th Qth\u03d5th \u2265 \u03d5\u22bathQth I 1 + \u03ba2 Qth\u03d5th = \u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252 1 + \u03ba2 (19) In the first step, we have used the fact that Qth is the projector to the eigenspace of B\u22121th . In the second step, we have used the fact that over the eigenspace corresponding to Qth, the eigenvalues of B\u22121th are at-least 1 1+\u03ba2 . We now invoke Assumption 2 in order to show that, along with the guarantees of reward free RL in phase 1, we conclude that: E [ \u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252|Qth \u0338= 0, Bth ] \u2265 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5 (20) Now, note by the fact that Qth is a projector and that \u2225\u03d5th\u2225 \u2264 1, we have: E [ \u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22254 \u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth] \u2264 E [\u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252\u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth] (21) Recall the Paley-Zygmund inequality which states that for any positive random variable Z, we must have: P(Z > EZ2 ) \u2265 1 4 (EZ)2 EZ2 . Therefore, P [ \u03d5\u22bathB \u22121 th \u03d5th > \u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5 2(1 + \u03ba2) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth] \u2265 P [\u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252 > \u03b3 \u2212 \u03f52 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth] \u2265 P [ \u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252 > 1 2 E [ \u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252 \u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth] \u2265 1 4 E [ \u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252 \u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth]2 E [ \u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22254 \u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth] \u2265 14E [\u2225Qth\u03d5th\u22252\u2223\u2223Qth \u0338= 0, Bth] \u2265 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5 4 (22) In the first step, we have used equation 19. In the second step, we have used equation 20. In the third step, we have used the Paley-Zygmund inequality and the moment bound in equation 21. Define the stopping time \u03c4 = inf{t \u2264 T : Qth = 0} and \u03c4 = \u221e if the set in the RHS is empty. Let \u039e0t for t \u2208 {0} \u222a N be a sequence of i.i.d random variables with the law \u03b3\u2212\u03f5 2(1+\u03ba2)Ber( \u03b3\u2212\u03f5 4 ). We consider the sequence of random variables \u039et = \u03d5 \u22ba thB \u22121 th \u03d5th for t < \u03c4 and \u039et = \u039e 0 t for t \u2265 \u03c4 Now, we apply the matrix determinant lemma which states that det(B + uu\u22ba) = det(B)(1 + u\u22baB\u22121u). We note that B(t+1)h = Bth + \u03d5th\u03d5 \u22ba th. Therefore, whenever t < \u03c4 , we must have: det(B(t+1)h) = det(Bth)(1 + \u039et) (23) Since \u2225\u03d5th\u2225 \u2264 1 almost surely, we must have Tr(Bth) = d\u2211 i=1 \u27e8ei, Bthei\u27e9 \u2264 d+ t It is easy to show that for any PSD matrix, A, if Tr(A) \u2264 \u03b1, then det(A) \u2264 (\u03b1d ) d (since trace is the sum of the eigenvalues and the determinant is the product). Combining the equations above, we conclude that whenever t < \u03c4 , we must have: ( t+ 1 + d d )d \u2265 t\u220f s=0 (1 + \u039et) Therefore, the event {\u03c4 > T} \u2286 { ( T+1+d d )d \u2265 T\u220f s=0 (1 + \u039et)} (24) Claim 7. P  T\u220f s=0 (1 + \u039et) \u2265 ( 1 + \u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5 2(1 + \u03ba2) ) (\u03b3\u2212\u03f5)T 8  \u2265 1\u2212 exp (\u2212c0T (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5)) Let \u03ba > 1 and T \u2265 C d\u03ba 2 (\u03b3\u2212\u03f5)2 log d\u03ba \u03b3\u2212\u03f5 , we have: P [ T\u220f s=0 (1 + \u039et) \u2265 ( T+1+d d )d] \u2265 1\u2212 exp (\u2212c0T (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5)) Proof. Let NT be the number of variables (\u039et)Tt=0 such that \u039et \u2265 \u03b3\u2212\u03f5 2\u03ba2 . Then, it is clear that\u220fT s=0(1 + \u039et) \u2265 (1 + \u03b3\u2212\u03f5 2\u03ba2 ) NT . Therefore, P  T\u220f s=0 (1 + \u039et) \u2265 ( 1 + \u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5 2(1 + \u03ba2) ) (\u03b3\u2212\u03f5)T 8  \u2265 P(NT \u2265 (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5)T 8 ) \u2265 P ( Bin(T, \u03b3\u2212\u03f54 ) \u2265 (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5)T 8 ) \u2265 1\u2212 exp (\u2212c0T (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5)) (25) Here Bin refers to the law of a binomial random variable. The first step follows from the fact that\u220fT s=0(1 +\u039et) \u2265 (1 + \u03b3\u2212\u03f5 2(1+\u03ba2) ) NT almost surely. The second step follows from equation 22, which shows that conditioned on Qth, Bth, the random variable 1(\u039et \u2265 \u03b3\u2212\u03f52(1+\u03ba2) ) stochastically dominates Ber(\u03b3\u2212\u03f54 ). The last step follows from an application of Bernstein\u2019s inequality for binomial random variables. Now, using equation 24 along with Claim 7, we conclude: P(\u03c4 > T ) \u2264 P (( T+1+d d )d \u2265 T\u220f s=0 (1 + \u039et) ) \u2264 exp(\u2212c0T (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03f5)) D.3 PROOF OF LEMMA 1: Proof. By the definition of Linear MDP, we must have Sh+1|Sh, Ah \u223c \u2211d i=1\u27e8\u03d5(Sh, Ah), ei\u27e9\u00b5ih(\u00b7) and Ah+1|Sh+1 \u223c \u03c0h+1(\u00b7|Sh). Therefore, for any bounded, measurable function g : S \u00d7 A \u2192 R, we must have: Eg(Sh+1, Ah+1) = E [ E [ g(Sh+1, Ah+1) \u2223\u2223Sh, Ah]] = E d\u2211 i=1 \u27e8\u03d5(Sh, Ah), ei\u27e9 \u222b \u00b5i(h\u22121)(ds)\u03c0h+1(da|s)g(s, a) = d\u2211 i=1 \u03bdih \u222b \u00b5ih(ds)\u03c0h+1(da|s)g(s, a) (26) D.4 PROOF OF LEMMA 9: Proof. It is clear from the assumption that E [\u222b g(s(h+1)t, a)\u03c0h+1(da|st)|(\u03d5ht)t\u2264T ] =\u2211d i=1\u27e8\u03d5ht, ei\u27e9 \u222b \u00b5ih(ds)\u03c0h+1(da|s)g(s, a). Note that T\u2211 t=1 \u03b1ht,\u03bd\u03d5ht = T\u2211 t=1 \u03d5\u22bahtG \u22121 \u03d5,h\u03bd\u03d5ht = T\u2211 t=1 \u03d5ht\u03d5 \u22ba htG \u22121 \u03d5,h\u03bd = ( T\u2211 t=1 \u03d5ht\u03d5 \u22ba ht)G \u22121 \u03d5,h\u03bd = G\u03d5,hG \u22121 \u03d5,h\u03bd = \u03bd (27) Therefore, E [ T\u0302 (g; \u03bd, \u03c0h)|(\u03d5l)t\u2208[T ] ] = d\u2211 i=1 \u27e8 T\u2211 t=1 \u03b1t,\u03bd\u03d5t, ei\u27e9 \u222b \u00b5i(h\u22121)(ds)\u03c0h(da|s)g(s, a) = d\u2211 i=1 \u27e8\u03bd, ei\u27e9 \u222b \u00b5i(h\u22121)(ds)\u03c0h(da|s)g(s, a) = T (g; \u03bd, \u03c0h) (28) Note that, conditioned on (\u03d5t)t\u2208[T ], \u03b1ht,\u03bd \u222b g(s(h+1)t, a)\u03c0h+1(da|s(h+1)t) are independent random variables bounded above by \u03b1ht,\u03bdB. Therefore, applying the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, we conclude: P ( |T\u0302 (g; \u03bd, \u03c0h)\u2212 T (g; \u03bd, \u03c0h)| > \u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223(\u03d5t)t\u2208[T ]) \u2264 2 exp(\u2212 t22B2 \u2211t \u03b12t,\u03bd ) Now, observe that \u2211 t \u03b1 2 ht,\u03bd = \u2211 t \u03bd \u22baG\u22121\u03d5,h\u03bd \u2264 1 \u03ba2 whenever G\u03d5,h \u2ab0 \u03ba 2I This concludes the proof.

In the last step, we have used the fact that for any bounded function, and any probability measures \u00b5, \u03bd, we have | \u222b f(x)\u00b5(dx)\u2212\u222b f(x)\u03bd(dx)| \u2264 supx |f(x)|TV(\u03bd, \u00b5).

Using the Hahn-Jordan decomposition of a signed measure, we conclude:\u2225\u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bd\u2032j\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 Tj(\u03d5, \u03bd\u2032j\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2225\u22251 \u2264 d\u2211 i=1 |\u27e8\u03bd\u2032j\u22121, ei\u27e9| \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u222b \u03d5(s, a)\u00b5i(j\u22121)(ds)(\u03c0j(da|s)\u2212 \u03c0\u2032j(da|s))\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 1 \u2264 d\u2211 i=1 C\u00b5|\u27e8\u03bd\u2032j\u22121, ei\u27e9|TV(\u03c0j , \u03c0\u2032j) \u2264 C\u00b5\u2225\u03bd\u2032j\u22121\u22251TV(\u03c0j , \u03c0\u2032j) (32) Combining equation 30, equation 31 and equation 32 we conclude:\u2223\u2223\u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 \u2212 \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bd\u2032j\u22121, \u03c0\u2032j)\u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2225\u03bdj \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251 + C\u00b5\u2225\u03bd\u2032j\u22121\u22251TV(\u03c0j , \u03c0\u2032j) + \u2225\u03bdj\u22121 \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22121\u22251 (33) Combining equation 29 and equation 33, we conclude the first inequality in the statement of the lemma. With a reasoning very similar to that in equation 29, we have:\u2223\u2223E\u0302\u03bd11 (\u03a0)\u2212 E\u0302\u03bd\u203211 (\u03a0\u2032)\u2223\u2223 \u2264 TV(\u03c01, \u03c0\u20321) + \u2225\u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd\u20321\u22251 (34) Using similar reasoning as in equation 33:\u2223\u2223\u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 \u2212 \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bd\u2032j\u22121, \u03c0\u2032j)\u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2225\u03bdj \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251 + ( T\u2211 t=1 |(\u03bdj\u22121 \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22121)\u22baG\u22121\u03d5,j\u22121\u03d5(j\u22121)t| ) + ( T\u2211 t=1 |(\u03bd\u2032j\u22121)\u22baG\u22121\u03d5,j\u22121\u03d5(j\u22121)t| ) TV(\u03c0j , \u03c0 \u2032 j) (35) Now note that for any \u03bd \u2208 Rd, we have: T\u2211 t=1 \u2223\u2223\u03bd\u22baG\u22121\u03d5,j\u22121\u03d5(j\u22121)t\u2223\u2223 \u2264\u221aT\u2211 t \u2223\u2223\u03bd\u22baG\u22121\u03d5,j\u22121\u03d5(j\u22121)t\u2223\u22232 = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aT T\u2211 t=1 \u03bd\u22baG\u22121\u03d5,j\u22121\u03d5(j\u22121)t\u03d5 \u22ba (j\u22121)tG \u22121 \u03d5,j\u22121\u03bd = \u221a T\u03bd\u22baG\u22121\u03d5,j\u22121\u03bd \u2264 \u221a T \u03ba2 \u2225\u03bd\u22252 (36) Here, in the first step we have used the fact that whenever x \u2208 RK , we must have \u2225x\u22251 \u2264 \u221a K\u2225x\u22252. In the third step, we have used the fact that \u2211T t=1 \u03d5(j\u22121)t\u03d5 \u22ba (j\u22121)t = G\u03d5,j\u22121 by definition. In the last step, we have used the fact that G\u0302\u03d5,j\u22121 \u2ab0 \u03ba2I . Plugging this into equation 35, we conclude:\u2223\u2223\u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 \u2212 \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bd\u2032j\u22121, \u03c0\u2032j)\u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2225\u03bdj \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251 + \u221a T \u03ba2 \u2225\u03bdj\u22121 \u2212 \u03bd \u2032 j\u22121\u22252 + \u221a T \u03ba2 \u2225\u03bd \u2032 j\u22121\u22252TV(\u03c0j , \u03c0\u2032j) (37) Using this and the definition of F\u0302 we conclude the second inequality in the statement of the lemma. equation 44 and equation 45 follow from a similar reasoning.

By equation 29 and equation 34, we conclude that \u03c01 \u2192 T0(\u03d5;\u03c01) and \u03c01 \u2192 T\u03020(\u03d5;\u03c01) are 1-Lipschitz with respect to TV() and \u2225 \u00b7 \u22251. sup \u03a0=\u03c01,...,\u03c0H\u2208Q \u2225T0(g;\u03c01)\u2212 T\u03020(g;\u03c01)\u22251 \u2264 sup \u03a0=\u03c01,...,\u03c0H\u2208Q\u0302\u03b7 \u2225T0(g;\u03c01)\u2212 T\u03020(g;\u03c01)\u22251 + 2\u03b7 We apply Lemma 9 co-ordinate wise to the co-ordinates of \u03d5 and union bound over Q\u0302\u03b7 . We have: P ( sup \u03a0=\u03c01,...,\u03c0H\u2208Q \u2225T0(g;\u03c01)\u2212 T\u03020(g;\u03c01)\u22251 > 2\u03b7 + d\u03b2 ) \u2264 d|Q\u0302\u03b7| exp(\u2212\u03b2 2\u03ba2 2 ) (38) Now, consider h > 1. Consider any \u03b7 net over Bd(1), denoted by B\u0302d,\u03b7 with respect to the norm \u2225\u00b7\u22251. We can take |B\u0302d,\u03b7| \u2264 exp(Cd log(d/\u03b7)) (Vershynin, 2018). Invoking Lemma 10, we conclude: sup \u03a0\u2208Q sup \u03bd\u2208Bd(1) |E\u03bd,h(\u03a0)\u2212 E\u0302\u03bd,h(\u03a0)| \u2264 sup \u03bd1,...,\u03bdh\u2208Bd(1) \u03a0\u2208Q |F\u0302 (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)\u2212 F (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)| \u2264 sup \u03bd1,...,\u03bdh\u2208B\u0302d,\u03b7 \u03a0\u2208Q\u0302\u03b7 |F\u0302 (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)\u2212 F (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)|+ 2 ( 1 + C\u00b5 + \u221a T \u03ba2 ) \u03b7h (39) Now, by the triangle inequality, we have: |F\u0302 (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)\u2212 F (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)| \u2264 \u2225T0(\u03d5, \u03c01)\u2212 T\u03020(\u03d5, \u03c01)\u22251 + h\u22121\u2211 j=1 \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj , \u03c0j+1)\u2212 T\u0302j(\u03d5, \u03bdj , \u03c0j+1)\u22251 (40) Therefore, by invoking Lemma 9, along with union bound over every component in the sum in equation 40 and over the net in equation 39 we conclude that: P  sup \u03bd1,...,\u03bdh\u2208B\u0302d,\u03b7 \u03a0\u2208Q\u0302\u03b7 |F\u0302 (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)\u2212 F (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh)| > \u03b2dh  \u2264 2dh|Q\u0302\u03b7||B\u0302d,\u03b7|h exp(\u2212\u03b2 2\u03ba2 2 ) (41) Combining equation 39 and equation 41, we conclude the second item in the statement of the lemma. The concentration ofX1 andXh follow in a similar fashion, but here we consider an \u03b7 net even over x and use the Lipschitzness results given in Lemma 10 and the fact that x\u2192 f(\u03d5;x) is 1 Lipschitz. E PROOF OF THEOREM 3: Lemma 9. Suppose h \u2208 [H \u2212 1], and g : S \u00d7 A \u2192 R be such that |g(s, a)| \u2264 B for every (s, a). For any policy \u03c0h and any \u03bd such that \u2225\u03bd\u22252 \u2264 1, we must have: P ( |T\u0302h(g; \u03bd, \u03c0h)\u2212 Th(g; \u03bd, \u03c0h)| > \u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223(\u03d5ht)t\u2208[T ], G\u03d5,h \u2ab0 \u03ba2I) \u2264 2 exp(\u2212\u03b22\u03ba22B2 ) Lemma 10. Let \u03a0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0H), \u03a0\u2032 = (\u03c0\u20321, . . . , \u03c0\u2032H) be policies in Q. Conditioned on the event G\u03d5,h \u2ab0 \u03ba2I , the following hold: |F (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121, \u03bdh)\u2212 F (\u03a0\u2032, \u03bd\u20321, . . . , \u03bd\u2032h\u22121, \u03bd\u2032h)| \u2264  h\u2211 j=2 C\u00b5TV(\u03c0j , \u03c0 \u2032 j)\u2225\u03bdj\u22251 + 2\u2225\u03bdj \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251 + TV(\u03c01, \u03c0\u20321) + 2\u2225\u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd\u20321\u22251 (42) |F\u0302 (\u03a0, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121, \u03bdh)\u2212 F\u0302 (\u03a0\u2032, \u03bd\u20321, . . . , \u03bd\u2032h\u22121, \u03bd\u2032h)| \u2264 \u221a T \u03ba2  h\u2211 j=2 TV(\u03c0j , \u03c0 \u2032 j)\u2225\u03bdj\u22252 + \u2225\u03bdj \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22252 + TV(\u03c01, \u03c0\u20321) + h\u2211 j=1 \u2225\u03bdj \u2212 \u03bd\u2032j\u22251 (43) Suppose x \u2208 Sd\u22121: |Th(f(\u00b7;x), \u03bd, \u03c0h)\u2212 Th(f(\u00b7;x\u2032), \u03bd\u2032, \u03c0\u2032h)| \u2264 2C\u00b5( \u221a d+ \u03bed) (\u2225\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u2032\u22251 + TV(\u03c0h, \u03c0\u2032h) + \u2225x\u2212 x\u2032\u22252\u2225\u03bd\u22251) (44) |T\u0302h(f(\u00b7;x), \u03bd, \u03c0h)\u2212 T\u0302h(f(\u00b7;x\u2032), \u03bd\u2032, \u03c0\u2032h)| \u2264 2 \u221a T \u03ba2 ( \u221a d+ \u03bed) (\u2225\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u2032\u22252 + TV(\u03c0h, \u03c0\u2032h) + \u2225x\u2212 x\u2032\u22252\u2225\u03bd\u22252) (45) Lemma 11. Condition on the event G\u03d5,h \u2ab0 \u03ba2I for every h \u2208 [H]. Fix some \u03b7 > 0 and let Q\u0302\u03b7 denote any \u03b7-net over Q. With probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b4/4, the following hold simultaneously: 1. sup \u03bd sup \u03a0\u2208Q |E\u03bd1 (\u03a0)\u2212 E\u0302\u03bd1 (\u03a0)| \u2264 C d \u03ba \u221a log ( d|Q\u0302\u03b7| \u03b4 ) + C\u03b7 . 2.

For any \u03b7 \u2265 0, and h \u2208 [H], suppose E\u03bdh(\u03a0) \u2264 \u03b7. Then, we have: \u2225E\u03d5(Sh, Ah)\u2212 \u03bd\u22251 \u2264 \u03b7 . Proof. Let S1:H , A1:H \u223c M(\u03a0). By Lemma 1, we conclude that: E\u03d5(S1, A1) = T1(\u03d5, \u03c01). Therefore we conclude the lemma for the case h = 1. Now let h > 1. Now, note that for j > 1, we have: E\u03d5(Sj , Aj) = Tj(\u03d5,E\u03d5(Sj\u22121, Aj\u22121), \u03c0j). There exists a sequence \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121 such that E\u03bd11 (\u03a0) + h\u2211 j=2 \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 \u2264 \u03b70 LettingE\u03bd11 (\u03a0) =: \u03b71, \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212\u03bdj\u22251 =: \u03b7j , we have from the case h = 1 : \u2225E\u03d5(S1, A1)\u2212 \u03bd1\u22251 \u2264 \u03b71. \u2225E\u03d5(Sj , Aj)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 = \u2225Tj(\u03d5,E\u03d5(Sj\u22121, Aj\u22121), \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 \u2264 \u2225Tj(\u03d5,E\u03d5(Sj\u22121, Aj\u22121), \u03c0j)\u2212 Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u22251 + \u2225Tj(\u03d5, \u03bdj\u22121, \u03c0j)\u2212 \u03bdj\u22251 \u2264 \u2225\u03bdj\u22121 \u2212 E\u03d5(Sj\u22121, Aj\u22121)\u22251 + \u03b7j (46) We have used equation 31 in the last step. Continuing recursively, we conclude the result Proof of Theorem 3. We condition on the event described in Lemma 11. We suppose that \u03ba, \u03b7 and \u03b70 are related as in the statement of the theorem. We will apply these values whenever we invoke the concentration bounds obtained from Lemma 11 in all the inequalities below. First consider h = 1. Let \u03a0\u0302f,1 = (\u03c0f,1H , . . . , \u03c0 f,H H ). By item 3 in Lemma 11, we have (with X1 as defined in the lemma): inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 T\u03021(f(;x), \u03c0f,11 ) \u2265 sup \u03a0\u2208Q inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 T1(f(;x), \u03c01)\u2212X1 \u2265 \u03b6 \u2212X1 \u2265 3\u03b64 Similarly, we have: inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 T1(f(;x), \u03c0f,11 ) \u2265 inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 T\u03021(f(;x), \u03c0f,11 )\u2212 \u03b6 4 Combining the two displays above, we conclude the theorem for h = 1. Now consider h > 1. We will first show that the constraint E\u0302\u03bd,h\u22121(\u03a0) \u2264 \u03b70 is feasible for some \u03a0 \u2208 Q and some \u03bd. Note that, for any policy \u03a0 there exists a \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdh\u22121 \u2208 Rd such that E\u03d5(Sj , Aj) = \u03bdj whenever S1:H , A1:H \u223c M(\u03a0). For the choice \u03bd = \u03bdh\u22121, we must have E\u03bd,h\u22121(\u03a0) = 0. Now, by item 1 and 2 of Lemma 11, we conclude that E\u0302\u03bd,h\u22121 \u2264 \u03b70. Therefore this optimization is feasible. Consider the solutions to the optimization problem given by \u03bd\u0302 and \u03a0\u0302f,h. Note again from Lemma 11 that E\u03bd\u0302,h\u22121(\u03a0\u0302f,h) \u2264 E\u0302\u03bd\u0302,h\u22121(\u03a0\u0302f,h) + \u03b70 \u2264 2\u03b70. Now, applying Lemma 12, we conclude that whenever S1:H , A1:H \u223cM(\u03a0\u0302f,h) \u2225E\u03d5(Sh\u22121, Ah\u22121)\u2212 \u03bd\u0302\u22251 \u2264 2\u03b70 By a similar reasoning as the case h = 1, we conclude: inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 Th(f(;x), \u03bd\u0302, \u03c0f,hh ) \u2265 3 \u03b6 4 Now, applying equation 44, we conclude: inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 Ef(Sh, Ah;x) = inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 Th(f(;x),E\u03d5(Sh\u22121, Ah\u22121), \u03c0f,hh ) \u2265 inf x\u2208Sd\u22121 Th(f(;x), \u03bd\u0302, \u03c0f,hh )\u2212 sup x\u2208Sd\u22121 |Th(f(;x),E\u03d5(Sh\u22121, Ah\u22121), \u03c0f,hh )\u2212 Th(f(;x), \u03bd\u0302, \u03c0 f,h h )| \u2265 3\u03b6 4 \u2212 2C\u00b5( \u221a d+ \u03bed) (\u2225\u03bd\u0302 \u2212 E\u03d5(Sh\u22121, Ah\u22121)\u22251) \u2265 \u03b6 2 (47) In the last step, we have used the lipschitzness bound for Th given in Lemma 10. Now we will show that the conditions given in equation 2 are satisfied for \u03c8(Sh, Ah) with parameters \u03b6/2 instead of \u03b6. \u2225\u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u22252 \u2264 1 almost surely follows from the definition of \u03c8. Now, Ef(Sh, Ah, x) \u2265 \u03b62 for every x \u2208 Sd\u22121 implies E|\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e9| \u2265 \u03b62\u221ad . For every x \u2208 S d\u22121, we also have: d\u03beE\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e92 \u2264 \u221a dE|\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e9| \u2212 \u03b6 2 \u2264 \u221a dE|\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e9| \u2264 \u221a d \u221a E\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e92 (48) In the second step, we have used Jensen\u2019s inequality. From this, we conclude E\u27e8x, \u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u27e92 \u2264 1 d\u03be2 for every x \u2208 S d\u22121 and thence E\u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u03c8(Sh, Ah)\u22ba \u2aaf 1d\u03be2 . F PROOF OF THEOREM 4: Let the unknown row set in the iteration t in the matrix estimation procedure of Section 6.1 be denoted by I\u0304t\u22121. For the analysis, we will use the convention that I\u0304t = \u2205 if the procedure terminates before the t-th iteration. Suppose Kt is such that for every t \u2264 logN , we have: Kt|I\u0304t\u22121| \u2265 C r|I\u0304t\u22121|+dr\u03b62\u03be2 log d \u03b6\u03be +C log( log N\u03b4 ) \u03b62\u03be2 . We will then show that the event {|I\u0304t| \u2264 1 10 |I\u0304t\u22121|\u2200t \u2264 logN} \u2229 {\u0398\u0302i = \u0398\u2217i ,\u2200i \u2208 I\u0304\u2201logN} has probability at-least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. To show this, it is sufficient to consider the step t = 1 with I\u03040 = [N ], K1 = K, \u03a8(1) = \u03a8 and show that with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4logN , I\u03041 \u2264 9N 10 and \u0398\u0302i = \u0398\u2217i for every i \u2208 I\u0304\u22011 . The result then follows from a union bound. We will therefore establish the following structural lemma and prove the Theorem 4. The rest of the section is then dedicated to proving Lemma 13. Lemma 13. Suppose the distribution of \u03c8ik satisfies equation 2. Let K \u2265 C(r+ dr N ) \u03b62\u03be2 log d \u03b6\u03be . Let Y(\u03a8) denote the set of all matrices \u2206 with rank at most 2r such that L(\u2206,\u03a8) = 0. Let IZ(\u2206) = {i \u2208 [N ] : \u2206i \u0338= 0}. With probability 1\u2212 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2NK) we must have: Y(\u03a8)\u2229 { \u2206 : |IZ(\u2206)| > N10 } = \u2205 Proof of Theorem 4. Let \u0398\u0304 be the rank \u2264 r matrix found satisfying L(\u0398\u0304 \u2212 \u0398\u2217,\u03a8(t)) = 0. By Lemma 13, we have that |IZ(\u0398\u0304\u2212\u0398\u2217)| \u2264 N10 with probability at-least 1\u2212 \u03b4 logN (by setting K = K1 as in the statement of Theorem 4). By Lemma 14, the probability that there exists an i \u2208 [N ] such that \u0398\u0304i \u0338= \u0398\u2217i , and \u2211K k=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8\u0398\u0304i, \u03c8\u0303ik\u27e9 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217ik\u2223\u2223\u22232 = 0 is at most |I| \u00b7 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2K) \u2264 \u03b4 \u00b7N\u2212c for some large constant c. From this we conclude that \u0398\u0304i = \u0398\u2217i for every i \u2208 I\u0304\u22011 . Lemma 14. Fix any \u0398\u0302. Suppose the distribution of (\u03c8ik)i\u2208[N ],k\u2208[K] satisfies equation 2. Then, there exists a small enough constant c such that: P ( \u2203i s.t. K\u2211 k=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8\u0398\u0302i, \u03c8ik\u27e9 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217ik\u2223\u2223\u22232 < K\u03b64\u03be2\u2225\u0398\u0302i\u2212\u0398\u2217i \u2225232d ) \u2264 |I| \u00b7 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2K). Proof. Consider the Paley-Zygmund inequality, which states that for any positive random variable Z, P ( Z \u2265 EZ2 ) \u2265 (EZ) 2 4EZ2 . Suppose i \u2208 I and denote \u0393i := \u0398\u0302i \u2212 \u0398\u2217i . By the properties of \u03c8ik, we have that E|\u27e8\u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9| \u2265 \u03b6\u2225\u0393i\u2225\u221a d and E|\u27e8\u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9|2 \u2264 \u2225\u0393i\u2225 2 \u03be2d . Applying the Paley-Zygmund inequality to the random variable |\u27e8\u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9|, we conclude the result in equation 52: P ( |\u27e8\u03c8ik,\u0393i\u27e9| \u2265 \u03b6 \u2225\u0393i\u2225 2 \u221a d ) \u2265 \u03b6 2\u03be2 4 (49) Let p0 := \u03b6 2\u03be2 4 . Let N(\u0393i,\u03a8i) := \u2211K k=1 1 ( |\u27e8\u03c8ik,\u0393i\u27e9| > \u03b62\u221ad ) . Clearly,\u2211K k=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8\u0398\u0302i, \u03c8ik\u27e9 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217ik\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u2265 \u03b62\u2225\u0393i\u222524d \u00b7N(\u0393i,\u03a8i). Therefore, we have: P ( K\u2211 k=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8\u0398\u0302i, \u03c8ik\u27e9 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217ik\u2223\u2223\u22232 < K\u03b64\u03be2\u2225\u0393i\u2225232d ) \u2264 P ( N(\u0393i,\u03a8i) < K\u03b62\u03be2 8 ) \u2264 P ( Bin(K, p0) \u2264 Kp02 ) \u2264 exp(\u2212cp0K) (50) Here Bin(K, p0) denotes the binomial random variable. In the second step we have used the fact that N(\u0393i,\u03a8i) is a sum of K independent Bernoulli random variables with probability of being 1 for each of them being at-least p0 = \u03b6 2\u03be2 4 . In the last step, we have used Sanov\u2019s theorem for large deviations. In the last step we have used Bernstein\u2019s inequality for concentration of sums of Bernoulli random variables (see Boucheron et al. (2013)). The statement of the result then follows from a union bound argument over i \u2208 I . F.1 PROOF OF LEMMA 13: Suppose I \u0338= \u2205, I \u2286 [N ] be any fixed subset. ByM(N, d, I, 2r), we denote the set of all N \u00d7 d matrices \u2206 with rank at-most 2r such that \u2225\u2206i\u2225 > 0 for all i \u2208 I . By B(N, d, I, 2r) we denote the set of all N \u00d7 d matrices with rank at-most 2r such that \u2225\u0393i\u2225 = 1 whenever i \u2208 I . Lemma 15. Suppose inf\u0393\u2208B(N,d,I,2r) L(\u0393,\u03a8) > 0. Then, L(\u2206,\u03a8) > 0 for every \u2206 \u2208 M(N, d, I, 2r) Proof. For every \u2206 \u2208M(N, d, I, 2r), we construct \u0393 such that: \u0393i = { \u2206i \u2225\u2206i\u2225 whenever i \u2208 I 0 otherwise (51) Now, by hypothesis, L(\u0393,\u03a8) > 0. This implies, there exists an i \u2208 I and k \u2208 K such that |\u27e8\u03c8ik,\u0393i\u27e9| > 0. This implies |\u27e8\u03c8ik,\u2206i\u27e9| > 0 and thence we conclude that L(\u2206,\u03a8) > 0. Lemma 16. Suppose \u0393 is such that \u2225\u0393i\u2225 = 1 for every i \u2208 I . Suppose the distribution of (\u03c8ik)i\u2208[N ],k\u2208[K] satisfy equation 2. Then, there exists a small enough constant c such that: P ( L(\u0393,\u03a8) < |I|\u03b6 4\u03be2 32Nd ) \u2264 |I|2K2 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2|I|K) Proof. Consider the Paley-Zygmund inequality, which states that for any positive random variable Z, P ( Z \u2265 EZ2 ) \u2265 (EZ) 2 4EZ2 . Suppose i \u2208 I . By the properties of \u03c8ik, we have that E|\u27e8\u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9| \u2265 \u03b6\u221ad and E|\u27e8\u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9| 2 \u2264 1\u03be2d Applying the Paley-Zygmund inequality to the random variable |\u27e8\u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9|, we conclude the result in equation 52: P ( |\u27e8\u03c8ik,\u0393i\u27e9| \u2265 \u03b6 2 \u221a d ) \u2265 \u03b6 2\u03be2 4 (52) Let p0 := \u03b6 2\u03be2 4 . Let N(\u0393,\u03a8) := \u2211 i\u2208I \u2211K k=1 1 ( |\u27e8\u03c8ik,\u0393i\u27e9| > \u03b62\u221ad ) . Clearly, L(\u0393,\u03a8) \u2265 \u03b64 4dNKN(\u0393,\u03a8) almost surely. Therefore, we have: P ( L(\u0393,\u03a8) < |I|\u03b6 4\u03be2 32N \u221a d ) \u2264 P ( N(\u0393,\u03a8) < |I|K\u03b6 2\u03be2 8 ) \u2264 P ( Bin(|I|K, p0) \u2264 |I|Kp02 ) \u2264 exp(\u2212cp0|I|K) (53) Here Bin(|I|K, p0) denotes the binomial random variable. In the second step we have used the fact that N(\u0393,\u03a8) is a sum of |I|K independent Bernoulli random variables with probability of being 1 for each of them being at-least p0 = \u03b6 2\u03be2 4 . In the last step, we have used Sanov\u2019s theorem for large deviations. In the last step we have used Bernstein\u2019s inequality for concentration of sums of Bernoulli random variables (see Boucheron et al. (2013)) Lemma 17. Suppose the distribution of (\u03c8ik)i\u2208[N ],k\u2208[K] satisfy equation 2. Let |I| \u2265 N10 . There exist positive constants c0, c, C such that whenever KN \u2265 Cr(N+d)\u03b62\u03be2 log d \u03b6\u03be , we have: P ( inf \u0393\u2208B(N,d,I,2r) L(\u0393,\u03a8) < c0 \u03b64\u03be2 d ) \u2264 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2NK) Proof. It is sufficient to prove this result for \u0393 \u2208 B0(N, d, I, 2r) \u2286 B(N, d, I, 2r), which is the set of all matrices such that \u2225\u0393i\u2225 = 1 for every i \u2208 I and 0 otherwise. Define \u2225\u0393\u22251,2,\u22ba := 1 N \u2211N i=1 \u2225\u0393i\u2225. Suppose \u0393\u0302 \u2208 B0(N, d, I, 2r) is such that \u2225\u0393\u2212 \u0393\u0302\u22251,2,\u22ba < \u03b7. Then, L(\u0393,\u03a8) = 1 NK N\u2211 i=1 N\u2211 k=1 |\u27e8\u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9|2 \u2265 1 NK N\u2211 i=1 N\u2211 k=1 |\u27e8\u0393\u0302i, \u03c8ik\u27e9|2 \u2212 2|\u27e8\u0393\u0302i \u2212 \u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9||\u27e8\u0393\u0302i, \u03c8ik\u27e9| (54) = L(\u0393\u0302,\u03a8)\u2212 \u2225\u0393\u2212 \u0393\u0302\u22251,2,\u22ba \u2265 L(\u0393\u0302,\u03a8)\u2212 2\u03b7 (55) In the third step, we have used the fact that \u2225\u03c8ik\u2225 \u2264 1 and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to imply |\u27e8\u0393\u0302i \u2212 \u0393i, \u03c8ik\u27e9| \u2264 \u2225\u0393\u0302i \u2212 \u0393i\u2225. Therefore, given any \u03b7 net of B0(N, d, I, 2r), denoted by B\u03020,\u03b7 , we must have: inf \u0393\u2208B0(N,d,I,2r) L(\u0393,\u03a8) \u2265 inf \u0393\u2208B\u03020,\u03b7 L(\u0393\u0302,\u03a8)\u2212 2\u03b7 (56) We will now parametrize B0(N, d, I, 2r) as follows: Claim 8. Every \u0393 \u2208 B0(N, d, I, 2r) can be written as \u0393i = {\u22112r k=1 uikvk if i \u2208 I 0 otherwise (57) Where v1, . . . , v2r are orthonormal vectors in Rd and ui = (uik)2rk=1 \u2208 R2r are such that \u2225ui\u2225 = 1. Proof. By the singular value decomposition, we have: \u0393 = W\u03a3V \u22ba for orthogonal matrices W,V and the singular value matrix \u03a3. Therefore, \u0393ij = \u22112r k=1 wik\u03c3kvkj Denoting uik := wik\u03c3k, we note that \u0393i = \u22112r k=1 uikvk, where vk is the k-th column of V . Now, it remains to show that \u2225ui\u2225 = 1. By ortho-normality of v1, . . . , v2r and the definition of \u0393, we have: 1 = \u2225\u0393i\u22252 = \u22112r k=1 |uik|2 = \u2225ui\u22252 Therefore, we construct an \u03b7-net for B0(N, d, I, 2r) as follows: consider any \u03b7/2-net over the sphere S2r\u22121, denoted by S\u0302\u03b7 2 (2r) with respect to the Euclidean norm. Similarly, consider any \u03b7 2 \u221a 2r -net over the sphere Sd\u22121, denoted by S\u0302 \u03b7 2 \u221a 2r (d). We draw (ui)i\u2208I , (vk)k\u2208[2r] from the set\u220f i\u2208I S\u0302\u03b7 2 (2r) \u220f k\u2208[2r] S\u0302 \u03b7 2 \u221a 2r (d) and take B\u03020,\u03b7 to be the set of all \u0393\u0302(u, v) of the form given in Claim 8. Claim 9. B\u03020,\u03b7 is an \u03b7 net for B0(N, d, I, 2r) with respect to the norm \u2225 \u00b7 \u22251,2,\u22ba. |B\u03020,\u03b7| \u2264 exp ( 2dr log( 4 \u221a 2r \u03b7 + 1) + 2|I|r log( 4 \u03b7 + 1) ) Proof of Claim 9. Let \u0393 \u2208 B0(N, d, I, 2r). Let (ui), (vk) be such that: Claim 8, \u0393i = \u22112r k=1 uikvk. By construction, there exists \u0393\u0302 \u2208 B\u03020,\u03b7 such that: \u0393\u0302i = 2r\u2211 k=1 u\u0302ikv\u0302k with \u2225ui \u2212 u\u0302i\u2225 \u2264 \u03b72 and \u2225vk \u2212 v\u0302k\u2225 \u2264 \u03b7 2 \u221a 2r for every i \u2208 I and k \u2208 [2r]. In order to show that \u2225\u0393\u2212 \u0393\u0302\u22251,2,\u22ba \u2264 \u03b7, it is sufficient to show that \u2225\u0393\u0302i \u2212 \u0393\u0302i\u2225 \u2264 \u03b7 for every i \u2208 [I]. \u2225\u0393\u0302i \u2212 \u0393i\u2225 = \u2225\u2225 2r\u2211 k=1 (u\u0302ik \u2212 uik)vk + 2r\u2211 k=1 uik(vk \u2212 v\u0302k) \u2225\u2225 \u2264 \u2225\u2225 2r\u2211 k=1 (u\u0302ik \u2212 uik)vk \u2225\u2225+\u2225\u2225 2r\u2211 k=1 uik(vk \u2212 v\u0302k) \u2225\u2225 = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 2r\u2211 k=1 (u\u0302ik \u2212 uik)2+ \u2225\u2225 2r\u2211 k=1 uik(vk \u2212 v\u0302k) \u2225\u2225 \u2264 \u03b7 2 + \u2225\u2225 2r\u2211 k=1 uik(vk \u2212 v\u0302k) \u2225\u2225 \u2264 \u03b7 2 + \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 2r\u2211 k=1 u2ik \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 2r\u2211 k=1 \u2225vk \u2212 v\u0302k\u22252 \u2264 \u03b7 (58) Therefore B\u03020,\u03b7 is an \u03b7 net with respect to \u2225 \u00b7 \u22251,2,\u22ba. By Corollary 4.2.13 in Vershynin (2018), we can pick: \u2223\u2223S\u0302 \u03b7 2 \u221a 2r (d) \u2223\u2223 \u2264 ( 4\u221a2r\u03b7 + 1)d and |S\u0302\u03b7 2 (2r)| \u2264 ( 4\u03b7 + 1) 2r and conclude the bound on the cardinality of B\u03020,\u03b7 . By Lemma 16 and a union bound, P ( inf \u0393\u0302\u2208B\u03020,\u03b7 L(\u0393\u0302,\u03a8) < \u03b64\u03be2|I| 32Nd ) \u2264 |B\u03020,\u03b7| exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2|I|K) \u2264 exp ( 2dr log( 4 \u221a 2r \u03b7 + 1) + 2|I|r log( 4 \u03b7 + 1)\u2212 c\u03b6 2\u03be2|I|K ) (59) Therefore, whenever taking |I| \u2265 N10 and \u03b7 = c1 \u03b64\u03be2 d for some constant c1 small enough, and combining equation 59 with equation 55, we conclude that whenever K \u2265 C(r+ dr N ) \u03b62\u03be2 log d \u03b6\u03be for a large enough constant C, we have: P ( inf \u0393\u2208B0(N,d,I,2r) L(\u0393,\u03a8) < c0 \u03b64\u03be2 d ) \u2264 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2NK) Now, consider |I| \u2265 N10 . The number of such sets I is at-most exp(c1N) for some constant c1 > 0. Therefore, applying Lemma 17 along with the union bound over all I such that |I| \u2265 N10 we have: Corollary 1. Under the conditions of Lemma 17, we have: inf I\u2286N |I|\u2265N10 inf \u0393\u2208B(N,d,I,2r) L(\u0393,\u03a8) > c0 \u03b64\u03be2 d with probability at-least 1\u2212 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2NK) We are now ready to prove Lemma 13. Proof of Lemma 13. Combining Lemma 15 and Corollary 1, we conclude that with probability atleast 1\u2212 exp(\u2212c\u03b62\u03be2NK), Y(\u03a8) \u22c2( \u22c3 I\u2286[N ] |I|\u2265N10 M(N, d, I, 2r) ) = \u2205 Note that if \u2206 \u2208 Y(\u03a8) such that |IZ(\u2206)| > N10 implies \u2206 \u2208 M(N, d, I, 2r) for some |I| > N 10 .

The authors propose a novel algorithm, leveraging this low-rank structure to improve efficiency and scalability.  The core idea is to decompose the reward matrix and learn individual user preferences within this decomposition, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality associated with a full reward matrix.  The paper presents theoretical analysis supporting the efficiency gains and empirical results demonstrating the algorithm's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe paper addresses the significant computational challenges posed by MURL, particularly when the number of users and actions is large.  It proposes a method that exploits a low-rank assumption of the reward matrix. This assumption is reasonable in many scenarios where user preferences exhibit underlying commonalities or latent factors. The authors decompose the reward matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD) and learn low-dimensional representations of user preferences.  This approach allows for efficient learning and generalization across users.  The paper includes theoretical analysis bounding the sample complexity and empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets (collaborative filtering).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The exploitation of the low-rank structure in the reward matrix for MURL is a novel contribution.  Existing MURL methods typically don't explicitly leverage such structure, resulting in higher computational costs.  This approach offers a significant improvement in scalability and efficiency, particularly for large-scale problems.\n* **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm, bounding the sample complexity under specific assumptions. This provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed approach and allows for a better understanding of its performance characteristics.\n* **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines in terms of both efficiency and performance, validating the effectiveness of the low-rank assumption.  The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the claims.\n* **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The methodology is clearly explained, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Assumption of Low-Rank Reward Matrix:** The main limitation of the proposed approach is the reliance on the low-rank assumption. While this assumption is reasonable in many scenarios, it may not hold in all cases.  The paper should discuss the sensitivity of the algorithm to violations of this assumption and explore potential methods for handling cases where the reward matrix is not low-rank.  Robustness analysis is crucial here.\n* **Limited Scope of Real-world Application:** While the collaborative filtering example is relevant, the paper could benefit from demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness on a wider range of real-world applications. This would strengthen the generalizability of the proposed approach.\n* **Scalability Beyond Low Rank:**  The paper primarily focuses on the benefits when the reward is truly low rank.  A discussion on how the method degrades (or if it degrades gracefully) when this assumption isn't perfectly met would be valuable.  This would add to the robustness of the argument.\n\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe paper presents a novel and promising approach to MURL, leveraging the low-rank structure of the reward matrix to improve efficiency and scalability. The theoretical analysis and empirical results support the claims made by the authors.  However, the limitations regarding the low-rank assumption and the relatively limited scope of the real-world application should be addressed.  Adding a more thorough discussion on these points, including robustness analysis and broader empirical evaluation, would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, the novelty and potential impact of the proposed algorithm are significant enough to warrant acceptance.
